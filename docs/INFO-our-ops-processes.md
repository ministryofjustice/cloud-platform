# Cloud Platform operational processes

This is a record of the operational processes that we will use to support our users and to maintain the cloud platform.

## Hours of support

Our hours of providing support are 10am - 5pm. During this time we will work on support requests from teams and make sure someone is available to answer questions in #ask-cloud-platforms.

Outside of these hours we will respond to high priority incidents as per our [on call]() process.

## Working hours

A member of the support team will be available online from 9am and until 6pm (it doesn't have to be the same person for both). This team member can be working remotely. We are doing this so that we cover incident response for the time when the person on call has is coming into the office or going home at the end of the day.

This support team member should be ready to respond to any high priority incidents.

## How does the support sub team work

The support sub team will consist of around 3 engineers. On average each cloud platform team member will be on the sub team for 2 weeks every 6 weeks.

The key activities for the day are:

_On starting the day (9AM)_
At least one engineer to:
* Check the #low-priority-alarms and #high-priority-alarms slack channels for any issues to investigate
* Check the board for any user requests that have been raised and not assigned
* Get a handover from the on call engineer about any issues out of hours
* Read through #ask-cloud-platform slack channel

_During support hours (10AM - 5PM)_
At least one engineer to:
* Actively participate in #ask-cloud-platform to field support requests, triage, prioritise and fix
* Monitor #high-priority-alarms and #low-priority alarms for incidents, triage, prioritise and fix
* Monitor user support requests being added to the board and triage them for priority

The whole support team to:
* Manage incident process for incidents in progress
* Work on user requests for larger work
* Work on support backlog stories

_Before ending the day (6PM)_
At least one engineer to:
* Handover information about any planned work or in progress high priority incidents to on call engineer
