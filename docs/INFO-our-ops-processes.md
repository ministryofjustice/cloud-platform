# Cloud Platform operational processes

This is a record of the operational processes that we will use to support our users and to maintain the cloud platform.

## Hours of support

Our hours of providing support are 10am - 5pm. During this time we will work on support requests from teams and make sure someone is available to answer questions in #ask-cloud-platforms.

Outside of these hours we will respond to high priority incidents as per our [on call]() process.

## Working hours

A member of the support team will be available online from 9am and until 6pm (it doesn't have to be the same person for both). This team member can be working remotely. We are doing this so that we cover incident response for the time when the person on call has is coming into the office or going home at the end of the day.

This support team member should be ready to respond to any high priority incidents.
