## Issue 1:
### Planning upgrade to EKS <upgrade-version>

Go through the EKS and Kubernetes release notes for version <upgrade-version> and create a plan to upgrade our clusters

Things to consider:

Review EKS / Kubernetes changelogs & release notes
EKS Module supported at target upgrade version?
Are there any API deprecations & removals? (Check EKS insights)
Are there new components being added?
What changes are being introduced to current components?
Are there changes to core infra of the CP required? i.e. Are all our current components compatible with <upgrade-version>?
Are there changes users need to make?
Do we need to expand any of our smoke/integration testing?
Create additional tickets needed for any findings specific to this upgrade

## Issue 11:
### Review cluster components for upgrading
https://runbooks.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/container-images.html#container-images-used-by-cluster-components

Review the compatibility matrix for all cluster components and verify if the image is compatible with the upgraded Kubernetes version

## Issue 12:
### Review and upgrade kube-state-metrics for the upgraded EKS version <upgrade-version>
https://runbooks.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/container-images.html#container-images-used-by-cluster-components

https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility-matrix

Review the compatibility matrix of kube-state-metrics and verify if the image is compatible with the upgraded Kubernetes version. If the version is a mismatch, check if the whole kube-prometheus-chart needs updating to get the default version of kube-state-metrics from the chart-> values. Otherwise, pin the kube-state-metrics image to match the Kubernetes version.

## Issue 13:
### Upgrade cluster autoscaler for EKS version <upgrade-version>
The Cloud Platform EKS Cluster is in Kubernetes version <upgrade-version>. Hence upgrade the cluster-autoscaler to match the Kubernetes version.

https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-cluster-autoscaler

## Issue 14:
### Upgrade cluster descheduler for EKS version <upgrade-version>
The Cloud Platform EKS Cluster is in Kubernetes version <upgrade-version>. Hence upgrade the descheduler to match the Kubernetes version.

https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-descheduler

## Issue 15:
### Post EKS version <upgrade-version> Cleanup
Following upgrade to EKS <upgrade-version>, there will be a number of cleanup activities that need addressing:

Update user guide / runbook references to EKS version
Update tools-image for kubectl version
Update cloud-platform-cli for kubectl version 
Update concourse pipelines to use updated tools-image and cli

## Issue 16:
### Add deprecated apis from <upgrade-version> to Gatekeeper
Following upgrade to EKS <upgrade-version>, create a new [gatekeeper constraint](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-gatekeeper/tree/main/resources/constraints) that stops people from using any apis that are now deprecated as a part of the <upgrade-version> upgrade.

## Issue 17:
### Update Upgrade runbook and Cluster Upgrade Issue Template

Update the runbook for 
- any changes needed in the steps to perform the upgrade
- any lessons learnt that could be useful for next upgrade
- any changes to the [upgrade issue template](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/cloud-platform-k8s-upgrade-template.md)
