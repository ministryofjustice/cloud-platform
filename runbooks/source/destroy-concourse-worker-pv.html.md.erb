# Destroy Concourse Worker PV's

## When should you use this document

We've had a number of incidents regarding the filling of concourse worker persistent volumes. While this document is a temporary solution, it should be used to solve the following high or low priority alarm:

```
[FIRING:1] KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp kubelet (manager https-metrics [REDACTED]:10250 /metrics concourse ip-172-20-36-113.eu-west-2.coâ€¦
```

or

```
[FIRING:1] :warning: KubePersistentVolumeFullInFourDays-Low
Alert: Based on recent sampling, the PersistentVolume claimed by concourse-work-dir-concourse-worker-3 in Namespace concourse is expected to fill up within four days. Currently 3.46 is available.
```

## How to fix the issue

As mentioned previously, this is a short term fix. The volume will eventually re-fill but it's important to document the short-term fix as well as plan a proper solution.

Authenticate onto the `manager` cluster:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name manager
```

Ensure no long running jobs are running in concourse, then run:

```bash
kubectl -n concourse scale sts concourse-worker --replicas 0 ; for c in {0..3} ; do kubectl -n concourse delete pvc concourse-work-dir-concourse-worker-$c ; done ; kubectl -n concourse scale sts concourse-worker --replicas 4
```
