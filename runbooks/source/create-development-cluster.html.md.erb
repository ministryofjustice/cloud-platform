2. Click on the `Run workflow` button.
3. Select the action - `deploy`.
4. If you wish to specify a custom cluster name, enter it in the `cluster_name` field. If you leave this as the default, a name will be generated for you in the format `cp-DDMM-HHMM`.
5. If you wish to deploy from a certain branch, enter the branch name (max 12 characters, this will truncate to this if over 12 characters).
