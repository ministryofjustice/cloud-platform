| Things we have learned | Justice Digital & Technology | Regularly when we have key things to show or promote | Show the Thing |
| Service impacting incidents | Service Teams | When an incident has been declared, key updates during resolution, and at incident closure | #cloud-platform-update |
| Sharing postmortems for service impacting incidents | Service Teams | When postmortem has been documented | #cloud-platform-update |
| Service impacting upgrades/Maintence | Service Teams | As required | #cloud-platform-update |

## Sharing formation with the wider Ministry of Justice and the Public

There may be occasions where we want to publish something to the wider MoJ or the Public. In these instances we can publish something on the MoJ Digital blog. Requests to publish on the blog should be made to #ask-comms in the first instance.
