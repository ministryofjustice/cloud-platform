# Cloud Platform Communications Plan

This plan details to the who, how and when we will communicate information to users and stakeholders.


## The Plan

The table below sets out the typical types of communications the Cloud Platform will want to issue.

| What information | Target Audience | When          | Channel               |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| New features | Service Teams | As features are shipped | #cloud-platform-update |
| Things we have learned | Justice Digital & Technology | Regularly when we have key things to show or promote | Show the Thing |
| Service impacting incidents | Service Teams | When an incident has been declared, key updates during resolution, and at incident closure | #cloud-platform-update |
| Sharing postmortems for service impacting incidents | Service Teams | When postmortem has been documented | #cloud-platform-update |
| Service impacting upgrades/Maintence | Service Teams | As required | #cloud-platform-update |
| Sharing successes | Chief Technology Officer | Weekly | One to ones and team meetings |
| Sharing successes | SMT | Fortnightly | Architecture & Platforms weeknotes |
| Sharing successes | Justice Digital & Technology | Regularly when we have key things to show or promote | Post about them in #chat on Slack/Consider for a Show the Thing |

## Tips on format of communications

The #cloud-platform-update channel is used for a number of different types of communications so it is important that messages posted have a clear description so that users can understand the importance of the message. In the case of incidents or upgrades the message should have a **bold** title that clearly describes what the message will be about.

### Examples

> **Kubernetes 1.14 Upgrade**

> **Incident - Sentry unavailable**

> **Action Required - Live-0 Decommissioning**

### Things to include in incident communications

- service impact/what users might be reporting
- action being taken (this might just be that we are investigating the issue)
- when users can expact a progress update (and make sure that the update actually happens when you say it will)
- details of any actions users need to take (if applicable)
- apoligise for the inconvenience (it might not be an issue in our control but this can build trust and let users know that you are taking resolution seriously)

### Example

> **High Priority Incident Declared - Cloud Platform**
> We are aware that some users are experiencing issues with the access to services on the Cloud Platform this morning.
> We are unsure of the full impact of these issues and the extent to which this is impacting services.
> An incident team has been formed and the team are investigating.
> We will provide further updates in due course, but in any event the next update will be in 30 minutes.
> Thank you for your patience.

### Things to include in upgrade communications

- What you are upgrading
- When the upgrade will take place (including times)
- Why you are upgrading (in might be useful to include a link to some change notes or something that users can refer to if they want more information rather than adding it all in the comms.)
- Details of any service impact or anthing users might need to take action on as a result of changes (including if we are pausing pipelines)
- Refer users back to the #ask-cloud-platform channel if they have questions or something isn't working as expected

### Example

> **Kubernetes 1.14 Upgrade**
> Please be aware that we will be upgrading the version of Kubernetes to 1.14 tomorrow (Friday 27th February) at 7am.
> More information on what's new can be found here - https://sysdig.com/blog/whats-new-kubernetes-1-14/
> There will be no downtime for this change. However we have noticed some latency during testing, and the Concourse pipeline will be paused.
> If you need to deploy any urgent changes to the Environments repository, or if you experience any other problems while the upgrade is underway please let us know over at #ask-cloud-platform. Many thanks.


## Sharing information with the wider Ministry of Justice and the Public

There may be occasions where we want to publish something to the wider MoJ or the Public. In these instances we can publish something on the MoJ Digital blog. Requests to publish on the blog should be made to #ask-comms in the first instance.
