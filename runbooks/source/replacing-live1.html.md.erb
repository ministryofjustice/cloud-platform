Treating clusters as [cattle, not pets] is one of our strategic goals.

The purpose of this document is to collect all the reasons we currently treat live-1 as a pet, so that
we keep them top of mind, and prioritise solving them.

> When we have an incident, why don't we build a new cluster from scratch, instead of nursing live-1 back to health?

## Reasons replacing live-1 is hard:

* Teams would have to adjust their deployment pipelines to target the new cluster (this doesn't seem particularly hard)
* Teams would need to rotate their CircleCI (or whatever) service account credentials in their deployment pipelines (this doesn't seem like *that* big a deal either, TBH)
* Something something cert-manager?
* Something something external-dns?

## Solved issues

* Restoring resources we don't control (e.g. certificates) is solved by Velero
