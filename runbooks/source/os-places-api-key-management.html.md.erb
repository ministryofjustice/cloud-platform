# OS Places API Key Management

The [OS Places API](https://developer.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/os-places-api) is the MoJ's product of choice for addess lookup and verification.

Service Teams require a key to access the API.

## Pre-requisites

You must have access to the OS Places API portal. If not, please contact your [administrator](mailto:os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk).

## Creating a new API key

1. Login the the [OS Places API Portal](https://developer.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/os-places-api).

2. Go to "My Keys".

3. Click "Add a new Key".

4. Input "Key Name" in the format `<Organisation> <Application> <Type of Environment>`.

> e.g. HMCTS Apply For Probate Online Production

5. Check the "OS Names API" and "OS Places API - Capture and Verification" boxes.

6. Click "Create Key".

This will return you to the "My Keys" tab. Select the key you created from the list. You should copy the value for `Consumer Key`. This is the key that you will need to send to the requester.

> Note - This key is a secret and should only be transfered via a secure method e.g. email of an encrypted archive with password in a separate message. 

## Revoking an API key

1. Login the the [OS Places API Portal](https://developer.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/os-places-api).

2. Go to "Support" and click on "Contact Us".

3. Complete the form ensuring you include details of the key you want to revoke.

This process can take a couple of days for OS Places to revoke the key. You can check if it has been revoked by going back to the Portal. If the `Consumer Key` value is <del>struck through</del> then the key has been successfully revoked.
