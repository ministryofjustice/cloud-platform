# Running Kops Update and Rollingupdate

We want to ensure Kops is updated regularly so there is a task in every sprint to run Kops update. It essentially updates various components / configuration coming from kops.

Note: This is for a kops update not an upgrade. A new release upgrade is described in [a separate runbook](upgrade-cluster.html).

## Using kops to change the cluster

Please do not be tempted to make changes to our production cluster(s) using
`kops edit...`

Our cluster state is set by:

> github code &rarr; generated kops yaml file &rarr; kops s3 config store &rarr; kops state &rarr; the cluster

Using `kops edit` skips the first two links of this chain, and causes problems
the next time we try to update the cluster 'properly', by starting with a
change to the code on github.

Instead, please use the procedure below, so that the code in github is always
the `source of truth` for the state of the cluster(s), and so that all changes
have been properly recorded and reviewed as pull requests.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-reqs:

- You are on the right cluster to run the Kops update.

```bash
$ kubectl config current-context
```

- Your are on the right AWS_PROFILE where the k8s cluster is created.

```bash
$ export AWS_PROFILE=xxxx
```

- Set the --state flag or export KOPS_STATE_STORE

```bash
$ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://<bucket>
```

- Launch a shell using the tools image

```bash
$ cd cloud-platform-infrastructure; make tools-shell
```

This will ensure you have the correct versions of all required software.

for live-1 KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://cloud-platform-kops-state

## Updating the kops state

The kops state file is generated from a template by the terraform code in [this directory][kops dir]. The key files are:

* `kops.tf`
* `variables.tf`
* `templates/kops.yaml.tpl`

### Generating an updated kops config file

After changing the files above, you need to generate a new `kops/[cluster name].yaml` file.

From your shell on the tools image:

```bash
kops export kubecfg [cluster name].cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
cd terraform/cloud-platform
terraform workspace select [cluster name]
terraform init
terraform apply
```

At this point, you should have an updated `kops/[cluster name].yaml` file in your working copy of the infrastructure repository.
Commit and push your changes, including those in the terraform source and template files.

### Applying local changes to the kops state store
  
#### Backup the remote kops state
  
If you want to preserve a backup of the current kops state on S3, you can do so like this:
  
```bash
aws s3 cp --recursive $KOPS_STATE_STORE/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk $KOPS_STATE_STORE/live-1-backup
```

This takes a couple of minutes. At time of writing, this was around 10G of data (mostly etcd backup tarballs).
  
> While the backup exists, `kops get clusters` will report "live-1" *twice*. This doesn't do any harm, but you do need to delete the backup in order to resolve this, either via the `aws` CLI too, or using the AWS web interface for S3.
  
#### Updating the remote kops state

To apply your local changes to the kops state stored on S3:

```bash
kops replace -f kops/[cluster name].yaml
```

WARNING: You will not receive any confirmation of this step.

After this, you should be able to do a `kops update cluster...` and `kops rolling-update cluster...` as described below, to apply your changes to the cluster.

## Running Kops update

Run kops update cluster Without `--yes` to check the configuration changes for the cluster, it will show you a preview of what it is going to do, this is handy to check what the changes are before applying the changes. Sometimes you will also have to kops rolling-update cluster to roll out the configuration immediately.

```bash
kops update cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Once you are happy, kops update cluster `--yes` to apply the changes.

```bash
kops update cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk --yes
```

It should report

>
Cluster changes have been applied to the cloud.

##  Running Kops rolling-update

This command updates a kubernetes cluster to match the cloud and kops specifications.

To perform a rolling update, you need to update the cloud resources first with the command kops update cluster.

If rolling-update does not report that the cluster needs to be rolled, you can force the cluster to be rolled with the force flag.

Rolling update drains and validates the cluster by default. A cluster is deemed validated when all required nodes are running and all pods in the kube-system namespace are operational. When a node is deleted, rolling-update sleeps the interval for the node type, and then tries for the same period of time for the cluster to be validated.

For instance, setting --master-interval=4m causes rolling-update to wait for 4 minutes after a master is rolled, and another 4 minutes for the cluster to stabilize and pass validation.

```bash
kops rolling-update cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk --yes
```

It should report below steps for all the nodes in the cluster.

```
Draining the node: “${node}”.
node/${node} cordoned
WARNING: Deleting pods with local storage: ${pod names}
pod/${pod1 name} evicted
pod/${pod2 name} evicted
…
pod/${podn name} evicted
Waiting for 1m30s for pods to stabilize after draining.
deleting node “${node}” from kubernetes
Stopping instance “${aws-instance}”, node  “${node}”, in group "nodes.${CLUSTER_NAME}.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk" (this may take a while).
waiting for 4m0s after terminating instance
Validating the cluster.
Cluster did not pass validation, will try again in "30s" until duration "5m0s" expires: machine “${aws-instance}” has not yet joined cluster.
Cluster validated.
```

Open new tab and watch the status of the rolling-update

```bash
watch -n10 kubectl get nodes --sort-by .metadata.creationTimestamp
```

Once the rolling-update is completed it should report

> Rolling update completed for cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}!

Check the cluster status with:

```bash
$ kops validate cluster
```

It should report

> Your cluster `${CLUSTER_NAME}.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk is ready`

## Possible Errors

While draining a node there is a chance that rolling update might be stuck at evicting a pod, then get the node it is stuck on and identify the pods running on there and delete the pod manually.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -owide --all-namespaces | grep ${node_name}
```
