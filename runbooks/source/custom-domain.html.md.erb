When a user is trying to set up a custom domain, as per this [user guide article], they will create a new hosted zone in the `cloud-platform` AWS account.

If this is a new sub-domain of `service.justice.gov.uk`, these steps are required:

* Wait for the new hosted zone to be created by the pipeline, once the user's PR to define it has been merged
* Find the hosted zone record in the Route53 section of the AWS console of the cloud-platform account, and copy the nameserver details from the `NS` record. Create a temporary copy of these values (on the clipboard or a text file)
* Switch to the mojdsd AWS account console, and find the [hosted zone for service.justice.gov.uk] in the Route53 section
* Use the "Create Record Set" button:
  * Name: The new sub-domain
  * Type: NS - Name server
  * TTL: 300
  * Value: The nameserver details you copied from the cloud-platform AWS account hosted zone
  * Routing Policy: Simple
