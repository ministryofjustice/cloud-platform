# Creating a live-like cluster

When testing cluster upgrades, it is useful to test the procedure which is as close to the live cluster as possible. The following steps will update an existing test cluster
to the configuration similar to the live cluster.

## Pre-requisites

- a test cluster created using the [cluster build pipeline] or manually

## Setting cluster size to match Live

1. Set the node group desired size to 60 (check the live cluster for up-to-date number) in the AWS console under Compute
2. Set the node_groups_count to same as live cluster (60) and default_ng_min_count to 60 in [terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/cluster.tf]
3. Copy the node_size values from live to default, currently `["r6i.2xlarge", "r6i.xlarge", "r5.2xlarge"]`
4. Copy the monitoring_node_size values from live to default, currently `["r6i.8xlarge", "r5a.2xlarge"]`
5. Ensure that your Terraform workspace matches your cluster name
6. Run `terraform plan` and confirm that your changes are correct
7. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes to your test cluster

## Installing live components and test applications

1. In [terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/components] enable the following components:
  * cluster_autoscaler
  * large_nodegroup
  * kibana_proxy
  * ecr_exporter
  * cloudwatch_exporter
  * velero

> To find components that are enabled in live but not in test you can search for `lookup(local.live_workspace, terraform.workspace, false)` in `components.tf`.

2. Add the `starter_pack_count = 40` variable to the starter_pack module

> Sometimes terraform will error out with an unclear error message this is usually due to a low default `ulimit` to fix this you can set `ulimit -n 2048`

3. Run `terraform plan` and confirm that your changes are correct
4. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes to your test cluster
5. You may need to run `plan` and `apply` again as the starter pack addons don't like to be installed all at once

## Upgrading a live-like test cluster

See documentation for upgrading a [cluster](upgrade-eks-cluster.html).

## Monitoring the upgrade

* Setup pingdom alerts for starter-pack helloworld and multi-container app

> When nodes recycle it's possible that the multi-container app will break giving false positives.

* Useful command liners
  * `watch -n 1 "kubectl get events"` - get all Kubernetes events
  * `watch -n 1 "kubectl get pods -A | grep ContainerStatusUnknown"` - get all containers in "ContainerStatusUnknown" state
  * `watch -n 1 "kubectl get pods -A | grep Error"` - get all containers in "Error" state
  * `watch -n 1 "kubectl get nodes --sort-by=\".metadata.creationTimestamp\""` - get all nodes and sort by create timestamp

* Useful third party tools
  * [K9s](https://k9scli.io/)
  * [Stern](https://github.com/stern/stern)

  You may refer to [Monitor EKS Cluster](/monitor-eks-cluster.html) section for more details.

## Final Tests

1. Run `make run-tests` from the root cloud-platform-infrastructure repository
2. Update `cluster.tf` `cluster_version` to match version upgraded to
3. Run `terraform plan` to ensure there are no unexpected changes
4. Go to `component` layer and scale up and down the `starter_pack` module to ensure `terraform apply` can run smoothly

## Tearing down

1. Run the delete cluster pipeline
2. Remove pingdom checks
