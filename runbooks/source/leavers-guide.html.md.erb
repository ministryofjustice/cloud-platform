# Leavers Guide

When CP team members leave, follow this guide, and log completion in a ticket.

## Revoking Access

### Digital Services

The Service Desk will be able to remove and revoke access from a number of different accounts outside of Cloud Platform.

#### 1/ Google account closure, ordered in advance of them leaving, by creating a ServiceNow order [Return device for Digital Mac & WTP users](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a1f163211bb1a8507b10ca286e4bcb7a)

This is not just about returning their Mac - it will do the important step of closing their Google account.

* Note - Include details in the ServiceNow request to transfer the leaver's Google Drive to someone in their team.

* Note - for leavers from the cloud-platforms team - ask the service desk to transfer any slack webhook integrations to someone in the team. <br>IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU REQUEST THIS BEFORE THE PERSON LEAVES<br>
This is because if the person has created a slack-webhook for alerting purposes, the loss of that slack-webhook can cause problems - when their profile is deleted (as the webhook link is referenced in [cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/cloud-platform-components/terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/cloud-platform-components/terraform.tfvars).

#### 2/ MOJ Digital VPN removal by creating a ServiceNow order: [Digital VPN add/remove](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6860adc01b8b6818f58d206fe54bcbe3)
