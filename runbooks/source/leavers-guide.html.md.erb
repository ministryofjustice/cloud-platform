# Leavers Guide

When CP team members leave, follow this guide, and log completion in a ticket.

## Revoking Access

### Digital Services

#### Google account closure
  This has to be ordered in advance of them leaving, by creating a ServiceNow order [Return device for Digital Mac & WTP users](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a1f163211bb1a8507b10ca286e4bcb7a)

  This is not just about returning their Mac - it will do the important step of closing their Google account.

  This is usually raised by the line manager for civil servants.

  * Note - Include details in the ServiceNow request to transfer the leaver's Google Drive to someone in their team.

  * Note - If the leaver has created any slack apps, these will need to be transferred to someone else in the team.

  Contact #digital-it-forum channel for any queries

#### MOJ Digital VPN removal
  Create a ServiceNow order: [Digital VPN add/remove](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6860adc01b8b6818f58d206fe54bcbe3)
  This is usually raised by the line manager for civil servants.

#### Slack account deactivation

  Cloud Platform maintain a list of webhooks for Alertmanager Notifications - Incoming Webhooks. When the slack account is deactivated,
  these webhooks will still be active. Hence, no action is needed.

  Some apps that member installed which require member-specific permissions may be atomatically deactivated.
  Check in advance, if the leaver has installed any such apps and if so, transfer them to someone else in the team by creating a ServiceNow order: [Slack tasks for the D&T Workspace](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=2749c237db9c609050fbbfce3b9619bb)
  Also make sure there there is atleast one other member who is collaborator for the app.
