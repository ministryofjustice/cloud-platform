# Leavers Guide

When CP team members leave, follow this guide, and log completion in a ticket.

## Revoking Access

### Digital Services

#### Equipment Return (including MacBook) and Accounts Closure
Only use this bundle to return, Digital MacBook’s and WTP devices. [Leaver Bundle – Digital
](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item_guide&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=61565d171b900510f58d206fe54bcbfa)

  This is usually raised by the line manager for civil servants.

  * Note - It is no longer possible to transfer a leaver's documents, etc. to another person as part of the leaver's process please transfer any documents to a suitable place before they leave.

  * Note - If the leaver has created any slack apps, these will need to be transferred to someone else in the team.

  Contact #digital-it-forum channel for any queries

#### Slack account deactivation

  Cloud Platform maintain a list of webhooks for Alertmanager Notifications - Incoming Webhooks. When the slack account is deactivated,
  these webhooks will still be active. Hence, no action is needed.

  Some apps that member installed which require member-specific permissions may be atomatically deactivated.
  Check in advance, if the leaver has installed any such apps and if so, transfer them to someone else in the team by creating a ServiceNow order: [Slack tasks for the D&T Workspace](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=2749c237db9c609050fbbfce3b9619bb)
  Also make sure there is atleast one other member who is a collaborator for the app.
