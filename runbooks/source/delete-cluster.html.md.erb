# Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster you must first export the following:

```
$ export AWS_PROFILE=moj-cp
```

Start from the root directory of a working copy of the [infrastructure repo].

## Delete the cluster using the script

There is a [destroy-cluster.rb] script which you can use to delete your cluster.

Read the script before using it. Deleting a cluster is something you should be very cautious about, and ensure you know exactly what you're doing.

The script is entirely non-interactive, and will not prompt you to confirm anything. It just destroys things.

### First, run `make tools-shell`

> The delete cluster script must *always* be run in a container. This ensures that the environment of the script is fully controlled, and you don't run into problems such as the kubernetes context being changed in another window, or extra environment variables causing unwanted effects.

Then invoke the script like this:

```
./destroy-cluster.rb --name [short cluster name] --yes
```

Run without `--yes` to do a dry run, and see what commands would be executed.

You can get more information using:

```
./destroy-cluster.rb --help
```

If any steps fail:

* Fix the underlying problem
* Edit the script to comment out any sections of the `ClusterDeleter.run` function which you no longer need to run
* Re-run the script

## Delete the cluster using concourse fly commands

In case you prefer concourse pipeline to destroy the cluster, these are the steps to follow, to delete the cluster using "concourse fly commands"

First, cd to the working copy of the concourse [pipelines repo][pipelines repo]. Make below two changes to the [create-test-destroy.yaml][create-test-destroy] file.

* In the create-test-destroy pipeline definition, literally add CLUSTER_NAME [var][concourse-vars], under params as below:
  ```
  params:
      CLUSTER_NAME: ((CLUSTER_NAME))
  ```
  We will specify the CLUSTER_NAME value using --var NAME=VALUE in the later step, when we run the fly command to set_pipeline.

* Comment out this line [here][cluster-name-export] in destroy-cluster job.

  ```
  args:
    # export $(cat keyval/keyval.properties | grep CLUSTER_NAME )
  ```

  commenting out this will not set the CLUSTER_NAME provided by the create-cluster-run-tests job.


Run the below commands updating the `<cluster-name-to-be-deleted>`. The first fly command will apply the changes made for the [create-test-destroy.yaml][create-test-destroy] file and set the CLUSTER_NAME [static var][concourse-static-vars], the second command will trigger the destroy-cluster job using the CLUSTER_NAME provided.

```
fly -t manager sp -p create-test-destroy -c create-test-destroy.yaml -v CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster-name-to-be-deleted>
fly -t manager trigger-job -j create-test-destroy/destroy-cluster
```
Note: After the destroy-cluster job completed sucessfully, run the [bootstrap pipleine][bootstrap pipleine] to discard the changes made to [create-test-destroy.yaml][create-test-destroy] file.

```
fly -t manager trigger-job -j bootstrap/bootstrap-pipelines
```
