# Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster you must first export the following:

```
$ export AWS_PROFILE=moj-cp
$ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://cloud-platform-kops-state
```

Start from the root directory of a working copy of the [infrastructure repo].

## Delete the cluster using the script

There is a [destroy-cluster.sh] script which you can use to delete your cluster.

> Read the script before using it. Deleting a cluster is something you should be very cautious about, and ensure you know exactly what you're doing.

> The script is entirely non-interactive, and will not prompt you to confirm anything. It just destroys things.

* Edit the script to change the value of `CLUSTER` to your test cluster
* Run the script: `./destroy-cluster.sh`

If any steps fail:

* Fix the underlying problem
* Edit the script to comment out any sections of the `main` function which you no longer need to run
* Re-run the script

## Delete the cluster manually

In case you prefer not to use the [destroy-cluster.sh] script, these are the individual steps to follow, to delete the cluster "by hand"

First, set the kubectl context for the cluster you are deleting. The easiest way to do this is with kops. e.g:

```
$ kops export kubecfg david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

You should see this output:

```
kops has set your kubectl context to david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Then, from the components directory, run these commands to destroy all cluster components, and delete the terraform workspace.

```
$ cd terraform/cloud-platform-components
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace select <clusterName e.g. cloud-platform-test-3>
$ terraform destroy -target helm_release.prometheus_operator # delete first, to avoid conflicts later
$ terraform destroy
$ terraform workspace select default
$ terraform workspace delete <clusterName>
```

Then run the following `kops` command (this will not delete the cluster).

Append it with `--yes` to confirm deletion.

```
$ kops delete cluster --name <clusterName>.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Change directories and perform the following to destroy the cluster essentials, and delete the terraform workspace.

```
$ cd ../cloud-platform
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace select <clusterName e.g. cloud-platform-test-3>
$ terraform destroy
$ terraform workspace select default
$ terraform workspace delete <clusterName>
```
