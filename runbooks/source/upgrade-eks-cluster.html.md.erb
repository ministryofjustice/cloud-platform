# Upgrade EKS cluster

The Cloud Platform EKS cluster upgrade consists of three distinct parts:

- Upgrade EKS Terraform Module
- Upgrade EKS version (Control Plane and Node Groups)
- Upgrade addon(s)
- Upgrade AMI version

The Cloud Platform EKS clusters are created using the official [terraform-aws-eks](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks) module.
The EKS version and addons are currently independent of the version of the terraform-aws-eks module.
Therefore, it will not always require an upgrade of the terraform-aws-eks module and/or the addons whenever there is an upgrade of the EKS version.
Please check the changelogs for the terraform-aws-eks module, the EKS version and the addons when planning an upgrade.

## Run the upgrade, via the tools image

The cloud platform [tools image](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-tools-image.git) has all the software required to run the upgrade.

Start from the root directory of a working copy of the [infrastructure repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure.git).

With your environment variables set, launch a bash shell on the tools image:

```bash
make tools-shell
```

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

- Your GPG key must be added to the [infrastructure repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure) so that you can run `git-crypt unlock`.

- You have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) profile `moj-cp` with suitable credentials.

- You have terraform and docker installed

- Review the changelog of the [Kubernetes release](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) and the [EKS release](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html) you are planning to upgrade to.

- Review the official [EKS upgrading a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html) document for any extra steps that are a part of a specific EKS release.

- Run [kubent](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble) against cluster to find deprecated APIs.

## Upgrade Steps

### Upgrade EKS Terraform Module

The first step of the EKS moduke upgrade is to identify the major version you want to upgrade to. Review the changes in the [changelog](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Create a PR in Cloud Platform Infrastructure repository against the [EKS module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/cluster.tf) making the change to the desired [terraform-aws-eks version](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks)

```
 module "eks" {
   source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
-  version = "v16.2.0"
+  version = "v17.1.0"
```

Based on the changes in the changelog, you can decide if the upgrade is a breaking change or not.

#### Upgrade with no breaking changes

- Execute `terraform plan` (or the automated plan pipeline) and review changes. If changes are all as expected, run `terraform apply` to execute the changes.

Note: When you run `terraform plan`, if it is only showing launch_template version change as below, executing `terraform apply` will only create a new template version.

```
  # module.eks.module.node_groups.aws_launch_template.workers["monitoring_ng"] will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "aws_launch_template" "workers" {
      ~ default_version         = 1 -> (known after apply)
      ~ latest_version          = 1 -> (known after apply)
```

For cluster node groups to use the new template version created, you need to run `terraform apply` again, that will trigger a re-cycle of all the nodes using terraform.
This can be disruptive and also incur terraform apply timeout. Hence, follow the below steps to update the node groups with the new template version.

To update the node groups with the new template version:
 - login to AWS console
 - click on the node group
 - click on `Change launch template version` option
 - select update strategy as `force update` and Submit.

This will perform a rolling update of all the nodes in the node group. Follow the steps in [Recycle all nodes](#recycle-all-nodes) section to recycle all the nodes.

#### Upgrade with breaking changes

Recent EKS module upgrade from 17 to 18 mentioned breaking changes to the resources. Hence, a non-distruptive process of creating new node group, moving terraform state,
draining the old node group and finally deleting the old node group was followed.

Detailed steps are mentioned in the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nv1WsqdYMBzjpO8jfmXEqjAY5nZ9GYWUpNNaMJVJyaw/edit?usp=sharing)

Any future upgrades where the terraform plan or the changelog shows breaking changes, the procedure needs to be reviewed and modified based on what the breaking changes are.

### Upgrade EKS version

#### Upgrade Control Plane

- Create a PR in Cloud Platform Infrastructure repository against the [EKS module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/cluster.tf) making the change to the desired EKS cluster version.

```
 module "eks" {
   source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
-  cluster_version = "1.14"
+  cluster_version = "1.15"

```

- Execute `terraform plan` (or the automated plan pipeline) and review changes. If changes are all as expected, perform the upgrade from the AWS Console EKS Control Plane.
Once the process is completed, [AWS Console](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home?region=eu-west-2#/clusters) will confirm the Control Plane is on the correct version.

Note: We don't want to run `terraform apply` to apply the EKS cluster version, as this will trigger a re-cycle of all the nodes using terraform. This can be distruptive and also incur terraform apply timeout.

```
$ aws eks describe-cluster --query 'cluster.version' --name manager
"1.15"
$
```

#### Upgrade Node Group(s)

The easiest way to upgrade node groups is through AWS Console. We advise to follow the official AWS EKS upgrade instructions from the [Updating a Managed Node Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-managed-node-group.html) documentation.

While updating the node group AMI release version, we should also change the launch template version which is created in step 2. To perform both the changes together, select `Update Node Group version` and  `Change launch template version` options as shown below. Select update strategy as `force update`, this does not respect pod disruption budgets and it forces node restarts.

**Testing the upgrade in a test cluster**

Testing the upgrade involves several things and varies depends on the changes involved. Some of the things to consider are:

- Run integrations tests
- Monitor Cloudwatch API logs for any failures
- Compare launch template before and after the upgrade and check for any variable changes
- Check for disk space, Ip subnet and IP allocations changes for any IP starvations. This might not be obvious in test cluster, but to monitor when upgrading live

#### Update kubectl version in tools image

kubectl is supported within one minor version (older or newer) of the cluster version. Update the kubectl version in the cloud platform
[tools image](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-tools-image.git) to match the current cluster version.

### Upgrade addon(s)

We have 3 addons managed through cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons [module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons).

Before every EKS major versions, check and upgrade if the addons versions doesnt match the EKS major version the cluster is currently on.

After every EKS major versions, check  and upgrade if the addons doesnt match the EKS major version the cluster you just upgraded to.

The following addons are managed through cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons [module](

[managing-kube-proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-kube-proxy.html)

[managing-coredns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-coredns.html)

[managing-vpc-cni](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-vpc-cni.html)

Create a PR in Cloud Platform Infrastructure repository against the cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons [module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/cluster.tf#L192) making the changes to the desired addon version’s [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons/blob/main/variables.tf#L28-L44). Execute `terraform plan` (or the automated plan pipeline) and review changes. If changes are all as expected, run `terraform apply` to execute the changes.

### Recycle all nodes

When a node group version changes, this will cause all of the nodes to recycle. When AWS recycles the nodes, it will not evict pods if it will break the PDB.
This will cause the node to stall the update and the nodes will **not** continue to recycle.

To rectify this, run the script mentioned in [Recycle-all-nodes- Gotchas](/recycle-all-nodes.html#gotchas) section.
