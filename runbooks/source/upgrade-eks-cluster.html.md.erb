# Upgrade EKS cluster(s)

EKS clusters are created using [terraform-aws-eks](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks) module, when new EKS is released it's usually followed by new terraform module version

EKS cluster upgrades consist in two things:

- Upgrade Control Plane
- Upgrade Node Groups

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

- Your GPG key must be added to the [infrastructure repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure) so that you are able to run `git-crypt unlock`.

- You have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) profile `moj-cp` with suitable credentials.

- You have terraform and docker installed

## Run the upgrade

### Upgrade Control Plane

As we mentioned before: almost always new EKS version implies new [terraform-aws-eks module version](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks). As an example, the following instructions were applied to upgrade from 1.14 to 1.15:

1) Create a PR in Cloud Platform Infrastructure repo [against EKS module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/cloud-platform-eks/cluster.tf) (file encrypted with git-crypt to protect users identity) which upgrade to the desired [terraform-aws-eks version](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks) that supports the EKS version you want to upgrade to

```
 module "eks" {
   source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
-  version = "v8.1.0"
+  version = "v10.0.0"
```

2) Execute `terraform plan` to check what is going to happen and finally `terraform apply` to execute the change.
3) Verify using [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or [AWS Console](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home?region=eu-west-2#/clusters) the Control Plane has the right version.

```
$ aws eks describe-cluster --query 'cluster.version' --name manager
"1.15"
$
```

4) Most of the time new EKS version implies new versions for `kube-proxy`/`kube-dns`/`aws-node daemonset`. The upgrade process can be found directly in the official [AWS Control Plane upgrade documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html) and **MUST BE FOLLOWED, PLEASE DON'T SKIP IT**.

### Upgrade Node Groups

The best way to upgrade node groups are through AWS Console. We advise to follow the upgrade instructions from the [official AWS Managed Node Group documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-managed-node-group.html).
