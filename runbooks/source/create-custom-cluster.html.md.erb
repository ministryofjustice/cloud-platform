# Create custom cluster

In concourse we have the ability to create custom clusters based of whichever branch you specify.

First we need to update the pipeline config with our branch, you need to run the following command from the `cloud-platform-terraform-concourse` repo root folder.

```
fly -t manager set-pipeline --pipeline custom-cluster  --config pipelines/manager/main/custom-cluster.yaml -v branch_name=migrate-eks-csi
```

From here you can then kick off the build from the concourse UI.

## Deleting your custom cluster

Our delete pipeline allows you to specify the `branch_name` in the config so to do this you run:

```
fly -t manager set-pipeline --pipeline delete-cluster --config pipelines/manager/main/delete-cluster.yaml -v branch_name=migrate-eks-csi -v cluster_name=tp-0000-0000
```

You need to pass both `branch_name` and `cluster_name` to the command.

##Â Rerunning stages in the create custom cluster pipeline

If you need to re-run a plan or apply at any stage after the cluster has been created you can do this by running the following:

```
fly -t manager set-pipeline --pipeline custom-cluster  --config pipelines/manager/main/custom-cluster.yaml -v branch_name=migrate-eks-csi -v cluster_name=tp-0000-0000
```

Then you can select the step in the pipeline that you'd like to re-run.

## Run integration tests against custom cluster

You can also use the `custom-integration-tests` job within the `custom-cluster` pipeline to execute the go integration test suite against a cluster of your choice:

`fly -t manager set-pipeline -p custom-cluster -c pipelines/manager/main/custom-cluster.yaml -v branch_name=<SOME-OTHER-BRANCH> -v cluster_name=<YOUR-TEST-CLUSTER-NAME>`

And then trigger a new build in `custom-integration-tests` job view.
