# Manually Delete Namespace Resources

We have a [script][deleter script] which will delete all of the AWS resources belonging to a given namespace, by running `terraform apply` with an empty `main.tf` file, and then running `kubectl delete namespace`.

> The script will not do anything if:
>
> a) the namespace folder exists in your local working copy of the [environments repository], or
>
> b) the namespace has `is-production: "true"`

NB: You need `ruby` installed, in order to use this tool.

To run the script:

1. populate the environment variables listed in the comment at the top of the script

1. cd to the root of a working copy of the [environments repository]

1. Run `bundle install`

1. Run the script, supplying the namespace name as the only argument, e.g.

```
./bin/delete-namespace.rb mynamespace
```

If you need to delete a production namespace, you will have to comment out the code which prevents that from happening.

That's the code block [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/blob/dd2e0049b5eb17d2925a55b22f4102896909a96b/lib/cp_env/namespace_deleter.rb#L71)

> If the script fails partway through, it may leave a new folder in your local working copy:
>
> `namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/[namespace name]`
>
> If this happens, just delete the whole `namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/[namespace name]` folder and re-run the script.
