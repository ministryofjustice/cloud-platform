# Recycle-node

Recycle-node pipeline runs every week-day, which executes the [recycle-node.rb][recycle-node-script] script to replace the oldest worker node by:  

* Draining the oldest node  
* Terminate the drained node.


## Guidence for cloud-platform team, when recycle-node pipeline job fails:

There are couple of reasons where [recycle-node pipeline][recyclenode-pipeline] job may fail.

1) `error: unable to drain node "ip-172-20-xxx-xxx.eu-west-2.compute.internal", aborting command...`

Recycle-node pipeline may fail because the pods exist without being part of a replicaset. These seem to be port-forward pods, usually used by developers to connect to an RDS instance from their development environment. 

We're running the process in a relatively gentle way, so it just fail the pipeline, rather than force-draining the node (which would have destroyed these pods).

The error will be similar as below from the logs of the recycle-node pipeline.

```
There are pending nodes to be drained:
 ip-172-20-123-244.eu-west-2.compute.internal
error: pods not managed by ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Job, DaemonSet or StatefulSet (use --force to override): port-forward
```

If [pipeline logs][running-pipeline] is not showing the pods which is causing the issue, using the node name form above, run the below command:

```
 kubectl --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data drain ip-172-20-123-244.eu-west-2.compute.internal
```

It will show similar message from recycle-node pipeline logs, but also give the list of pods, which is causing the error.


```
There are pending nodes to be drained:
 ip-172-20-123-244.eu-west-2.compute.internal
error: cannot delete Pods not managed by ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Job, DaemonSet or StatefulSet (use --force to override): licences-dev/port-forward
```

Since developers create port-forward pods only used briefly, we track down the namespace owner and ask them to clear them up, by sending a message in the #ask-cloud-platform, something like below.

```
Recycle-node job failed to replace the node, as it failed to drain the pod.
If any of these pods are yours, and you're not using them anymore, please could you delete them so that the next time the recycle-node job runs, it is able to replace the node.

licences-dev/port-forward
```

Once the pod which is causing the issue gets deleted, re-run the pipeline which will drain the node successfully and terminate the drained node.


2) `error when evicting pod "some-pod-84d68b65b8-cl6xq" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget`

This is because pod may stuck in ImagePullBackoff status. The error is misleading, as error message talks about pod disruption budgets.

In this case identify the pod and delete it manually and re-run the pipeline which will drain the node successfully and terminate the drained node.
