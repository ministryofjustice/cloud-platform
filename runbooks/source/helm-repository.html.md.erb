# Cloud Platform helm chart repository

The cloud-platform team uses Github pages for our helm chart repository. The main advantage is maintainability - we don't need to run any additional infrastructure, just manage the source code.

The [github repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helm-charts) has more details.

## Performing CRUD on Cloud Platform Helm repository

The main README of the [github project](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helm-charts) includes a detailed guide for how to create, delete and update Helm Chart repositories.
