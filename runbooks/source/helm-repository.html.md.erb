# Cloud Platform helm chart repository

The cloud-platform team uses Github pages for our helm chart repository. The main advantage is maintainability - we don't need to run any additional infrastructure, just manage the source code.

The [github repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helm-charts) has more details.
