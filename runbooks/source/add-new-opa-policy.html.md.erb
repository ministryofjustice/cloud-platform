# Open Policy Agent policies

Policies are version controlled in the [`cloud-platform-infrastructure`][policies-repo] repository.

## Adding a policy

Create a new `.rego` file in the location above. Our policies are currently all defined in the
`cloud_platform.admission` package and uses the `deny` rule to evaluate any checks:

For example, the following policy would deny all `Services` of type `Loadbalancer`

```
package cloud_platform.admission

import data.kubernetes.namespaces

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Service"
  input.request.object.spec.type == "LoadBalancer"
}
```

## Writing tests

Testing the policies against live data is not a straightforward process and debugging policies is quite minimal at the
moment. The best way to develop policies is by practicing test-driven development.

Assuming you have created `my_policy.rego` with your `deny` rule defined, you simply need to create
`my_policy_test.rego` to define your tests. You can look at the existing policies for examples. There are a few generic
mocking functions defined which you might find useful.

Finally, testing the policies, you should see something like this:

```
$ opa test -v .
data.cloud_platform.admission.test_ingress_create_allowed: PASS (1.956µs)
data.cloud_platform.admission.test_ingress_create_conflict: PASS (1.518µs)
data.cloud_platform.admission.test_ingress_update_same_host: PASS (1.088µs)
data.cloud_platform.admission.test_ingress_update_new_host: PASS (1.246µs)
data.cloud_platform.admission.test_ingress_update_existing_host: PASS (1.417µs)
data.cloud_platform.admission.test_ingress_update_existing_host_other_namespace: PASS (1.295µs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PASS: 6/6
```

Additionally, tests will be run against pull requests to the repository in a CircleCI job.
