# Open Policy Agent policies

We use OPA policies to restrict (Gatekeeper refer to this as constraints) what users can and cannot do in the cluster.

Policies are version controlled in the [`cloud-platform-infrastructure`][policies-repo] repository. We manage these policies through [Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/). See the gatekeeper [README](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-gatekeeper/blob/main/README.md) for implementation, testing and method instructions.
