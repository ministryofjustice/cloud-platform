This runbook is for namespaces which are migrated to `live` EKS cluster from `live-1` cluster. 

Check the below list before proceeding with the deletion

- all dependencies to the namespace are removed. Some namespaces have terraform in one namespace creating k8s resources in another namespace. Raise PR and remove those dependencies in other namespaces
- namespace folder exists in `live.cloud-platform...` folder in [env][https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk] repository
- `apply-live` pipeline is applying the namespace and no changes needed
- namespace exists in `live` cluster
- all ingresses in that namespace in `live` has `aws-weight` annotation with value "100"
- all ingresses in that namespace  in `live-1` has `aws-weight` annotation with value "0"
- kibana logs for that namespace doesnot have any traffic flow for `live-1`
- Check for any cronjobs/tzcronjobs or batch jobs running in `live-1` and compare with the one in `live`.
  - If any queries, check with the team who owns the namespace.

To delete the namespace, target the `live-1` cluster

run the command

```
kubectl delete ns <namespace>
```

For deleting a namespace from a cluster including terraform resources because it is not used anymore, follow [Manually Delete Namespace Resources](./manually-delete-namespace-resources.html) runbook.
