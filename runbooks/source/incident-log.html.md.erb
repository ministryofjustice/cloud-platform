- **Time to repair**: 35h 36m

- **Time to resolve**: 35h 36m

- **Identified**: [PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C8PF51AT0/p1698833753414539)

- **Impact**: Prometheus is not Available. The Cloud Platform lose the monitoring for a period of time.

- **Context**:
  - 2023-11-01 10:15: PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN. Team acknowledged and checked the state of the Prometheus server.
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: PagerDuty for Prometheus alerted 3rd time in a row in just few minutes interval. Incident declared
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: Prometheus pod has restarted and the prometheus container is starting
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: Prometheus logs shows there are numerous Evaluation rule failed
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: Events in monitoring namespace recorded Readiness Probe failed for Prometheus
  - 2023-11-01 12:35: Team enabled debug log level for prometheus to understand the issue
  - 2023-11-03 16:01: After investigating the logs, team found that one possible root cause might be the readiness Probe failure prior to the restart of prometheus. Hence team increased the readiness probe timeout
  - 2023-11-03 16:01: Incident repaired and resolved.

- **Resolution**:
  - Team identified that the readiness probe was failing and the prometheus was restarted.
  - Increased the readiness probe timeout from 3 to 6 seconds to avoid the restart of prometheus

- **Review actions**:
  - Team discussed about having closer inspection and try to identify these kind of failures earlier
  - Investigate if the ingestion of data to the database is too big or long
  - Is executing some queries making prometheus work harder and stop responding to the readiness probe?
  - Any other services which is probing prometheus that triggers the restart
  - Is taking regular velero backups distrubing the ebs read/write and causing the restart?

- **Identified**: [PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C8PF51AT0/p1690290348206639)

- **Impact**: Prometheus is not Available. The Cloud Platform lose the monitoring for a period of time.

- **Context**:
  - 2023-07-25 14:05 - PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN. Team acknowledged and checked the state of the Prometheus server. Prometheus errored for Rule evaluation and Exit code 137
  - 2023-07-25 14:09: Prometheus pod is in terminating state
  - 2023-07-25 14:17: The node where prometheus is running went to Not Ready state
  - 2023-07-25 14:22: Drain the monitoring node which moved the prometheus to the another monitoring node
  - 2023-07-25 14:56: After moving to new node the prometheus restarted just after coming back and put the node to Node Ready State
  - 2023-07-25 15:11: Comms went to cloud-platform-update on Prometheus was DOWN
  - 2023-07-25 15:20: Team found that the node memory is spiking to 89% and decided to go for a bigger instance size
  - 2023-07-25 15:21: Incident declared. https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1690294889724869
  - 2023-07-25 15:31: Changed the instance size to `r6i.4xlarge`
  - 2023-07-25 15:50: Still the Prometheus restarted after running. Team found the recent prometheus pod was terminated with OOMKilled. Increased the memory limits 100Gi
  - 2023-07-25 16:18: Updated the prometheus container limits:CPU - 12 core and 110 Gi Memory to accommodate the resource need for prometheus
  - 2023-07-25 16:18: Incident repaired
  - 2023-07-05 16:18: Incident resolved

- **Resolution**:
  - Due to increased number of namespaces and prometheus rules, the prometheus server needed more memory. The instance size was not enough to keep prometheus running.
  - Updating the node type to double the cpu and memory and increasing the container resource limit of prometheus server resolved the issue

- **Review actions**:
  - Add alert to monitor the node memory usage and if a pod is using up most of the node memory [#4538](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/4538)

  - 2023-06-06 11:21 - Incident repaired
  - 2023-06-06 13:11 - Incident resolved

- **Resolution**:
  - When the node instance type is changed, the nodes are recycled all at a time. This caused the pods to be deleted all at once.
  - Raised a ticket with AWS asking the steps to update the node instance type without causing outage to the services.
  - The instance type update is performed through terraform, hence the team will have to comeup with a plan and update runbook to perform these changes without downtime.

- **Review actions**:
  - Add a runbook for the steps to perform when changing the node instance type

- **Key events**
  - First detected: 2023-02-02 10:14
  - Incident declared: 2023-02-02 10:20
  - Repaired: 2023-02-02 10:20
  - Resolved 2023-02-02 11:36

- **Time to repair**: 0h 30m

- **Time to resolve**: 1h 22m

- **Identified**: [CPU-Critical alert](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/incidents/Q01V8OZ44WU4EX?utm_campaign=channel&utm_source=slack)

- **Impact**: Cluster is reaching max capacity. Multiple services might be affected.

- **Context**:
  - 2023-02-02 10:14: [CPU-Critical alert](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/incidents/Q01V8OZ44WU4EX?utm_campaign=channel&utm_source=slack)
  - 2023-02-02 10:21: Cloudp Platform Team supporting with CJS deployment and noticed that the CJS team increased the pod count and requested more resources causing the CPU critical alert.
  - 2023-02-02 10:21 **Incident is declared**.
  - 2023-02-02 10:22 War room started.
  - 2023-02-02 10:25 Cloud Platform noticed that the CJS team have 100 replicas for their deployment and many CJS pods started crash looping, this is due to the Descheduler service **RemoveDuplicates** strategy plugin making sure that there is only one pod associated with a ReplicaSet running on the same node. If there are more, those duplicate pods are evicted for better spreading of pods in a cluster.
  - The live cluster has 60 nodes as desired capacity. As CJS have 100 ReplicaSet for their deployment, Descheduler started terminating the duplicate CJS pods scheduled on the same node. The restart of multiple CJS pods caused the CPU hike.
  - 2023-02-02 10:30 Cloud Platform team scaled down Descheduler to stop terminating CJS pods.
  - 2023-02-02 10:37 CJS Dash team planned to roll back a caching change they made around 10 am that appears to have generated the spike.
  - 2023-02-02 10:38 Decision made to (Increase or Decrease?) node count to 60 from 80, to support the CJS team with more pods and resources.
  - 2023-02-02 10:40 Autoscaling group bumped up to 80 - to resolve the CPU critical. Descheduler is scaled down to 0 to accommodate multiple pods on a node.
  - 2023-02-02 10:44 Resolved status for CPU-Critical high-priority alert.
  - 2023-02-02 11:30 Performance has steadied.
  - 2023-02-02 11:36 **Incident is resolved**.

- **Resolution**:
  - Cloud-platform team scaling down Descheduler to let CJS team have 100 ReplicaSet in their deployment.
  - CJS Dash team rolled back a change that appears to have generated the spike.
  - Cloud-Platform team increasing the desired node count to 80.

- **Review actions**:
  - Create an OPA policy to not allow deployment ReplicaSet greater than an agreed number by the cloud-platform team.
  - Update the user guide to mention related to OPA policy.
  - Update the user guide to request teams to speak to the cloud-platform team before if teams are planning to apply deployments which need large resources like pod count, memory and CPU so the cloud-platform team is aware and provides the necessary support.

### Incident on 2023-01-05 08:56 - CircleCI Security Incident

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2023-01-04 (Time TBC)
  - Incident declared: 2022-01-05 08:56
  - Repaired 2023-02-01 10:30
  - Resolved 2022-02-01 10:30

- **Time to repair**: 673h 34m

- **Time to resolve**: 673h 34m

- **Identified**: CircleCI announced a [security alert on 4th January 2023](https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/). Their advice was for any and all secrets stored in CircleCI to be rotated immediately as a cautionary measure.

- **Impact**: Exposure of secrets stored within CircleCI for running various services associated with applications running on the Cloud Platform.

- **Context**: Users of the Cloud Platform use CircleCI for CI/CD including deployments into the Cloud Platform. Access for CircleCI into the Cloud Platform is granted by generating a namespace enclosed service-account with required permission set by individual teams/users.
As all service-account access/permissions were set based on user need, some service-accounts had access to all stored secrets within the namespace it was created in.
As part of our preliminary investigation, it was also discovered service-accounts were shared between namespaces which exposed this incident wider than first anticipated.
We made the decision that we need to rotate any and all secrets used within the cluster.

- **Resolution**: Due to the unknown nature opf some of the secrets that may have been exposed a prioritised phased approach was created:
  - Phase 1
    Rotate the secret access key all service-accounts named “circle-*”
    Rotate the secret access key for all other service-accounts
    Rotate all IRSA service-accounts

  - Phase 2
    Rotate all AWS keys within namespaces which had a CircleCI service-account

  - Phase 3
    Rotate all AWS keys within all other namespaces not in Phase 2

  - Phase 4
    Create and publish guidance for users to rotate all other secrets within namespaces and AWS keys generated via a Cloud Platform Module

  - Phase 5
    Clean up any other IAM/Access keys not managed via code within the AWS account.

Full detailed breakdown of events can be found in the [postmortem notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQXzLtiXorRIcyt8YdBu24ZSZqNAFrXVhSSIAy3242A/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Review actions**:
  - Implement Trivy scanning for container vulnerability (Done)
  - Implement Secrets Manager
  - Propose more code to be managed in cloud-platform-environments repository
  - Look into a Terraform resource for CircleCI
  - Use IRSA instead of AWS Keys

- **Impact**: Prometheus was unavailable for 27 minutes. Not reported at all by users in #ask-cloud-platforms slack channel.

- **Context**:
  - On the 1st of November 14:49 AWS - notifications sent an email - advising that instance i-087e420c573463c08 (prometheus-operator) would be retired on the 15th of November 2022 at 16:00

  - On the 15th of November 2022 - work being carried out on a Kubernetes upgrade on the "manager" cluster. Cloud-platforms advised in slack in the morning that the instance on "manager" would be retired that very afternoon. It was thought therefore that that this would have little impact on the upgrade work. However the instance was in fact on the "live" cluster - not "manager"

  - The instance was retired by AWS at 16:00, Prometheus went down approx 16:03.

  - Because the node was killed by AWS, and not gracefully by us - it got stuck - the eks node stayed in a status of "not ready", the pod stays as "terminated"

  - Note were users notified in "ask-cloud-platform" slack channel at approx 16:25, once it was determined that it was NOT to do with Kubernetes upgrade work on "manager" and therefore it would indeed be having an impact on the live system.

- **Resolution**:

  - The pod was killed by us at approx 16:12, this therefore made the node go too.

- **Review actions**:
  - If we had picked up on this retirement in "Live"- we could have recyled the node  gracefully (cordon, drain and kill first), possibly straight way on the 1st of November (well in advance).

  - Therefore we need to find a way of not having these notification buried in our email inbox.

  - First course of action, to ask AWS if there is an recomended alterative way of notifying to our slack channel (an alert). be this by sns to slack or some other method

  - AWS Support Case ID 11297456601 raised

  - AWS advise received - ticket raised to investigate potential solutions: [Implementation of notification of Scheduled Instance Retirements - to Slack. Investigate 2 potential AWS solutions#4264](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cloud-platform-team-5ccb0b8a81f66118c983c189/issues/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/4264).

- **Time to repair**: 6h 27m

- **Time to resolve**: 6h 27m

- **Identified**: Users reported in #ask-cloud-platform they're experiencing slow performance of their applications some of the time.

- **Impact**: Slow performance of 25% of ingress traffic

- **Context**:
  - Following an AWS incident the day before, one of three network interfaces on the 'default' ingress controllers were experiencing slow performance.
  - AWS claim, "the health checking subsystem did not correctly detect some of your targets as unhealthy, which resulted in clients timing out when they attempted to connect to one of your Network Load Balancer (NLB) Elastic IP's (EIPs)".
  - AWS go onto say, "The Networkd Load Balancer (NLB) has a health checking subsystem that checks the health of each target, and if a target is detected as unhealthy it is removed from service. During this issue, the health checking subsystem was unaware of the health status of your the targets in one of the Availability Zones (AZ)".

  - Slack thread: [#cloud-platform-update](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CH6D099DF/p1657531797170269) for the incident

- **Resolution**:
  - AWS internal components have been restarted. AWS say, "The root cause was a latent software race condition that was triggered when some of the health checking instances were restarted. Since the health checking subsystem was unaware of the targets, it did not return a health check status for a specific Availability Zone (AZ) of the NLB".

  - They (AWS) go onto say, "We restarted the health checking subsystem, which caused it to refresh the list of targets, after this the NLB was recovered in the impacted AZ".

- **Identified**: Users reported in #ask-cloud-platform that they are seeing errors for CP domain urls.
```Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames```

- **Impact**: All ingress resources using the *apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk have mismatched certificates.

- **Context**:
  - Occurred immediately following a terraform apply to a test cluster
  - The change amended the default certificate of `live` cluster to `*.apps.yy-1003-0100.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`.

  - Slack thread: [#ask-cloud-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C57UPMZLY/p1646912939256309) for the incident

- **Resolution**:
  - The immediate repair was to perform an inline edit of the default certificate in `live`. Adding the wildcard dnsNames `*.apps.live`,`*.live`, `*.apps.live-1` and `*.live-1` to the default certificate i.e. reverting the faulty change.
  - Further investigation followed finding the cause of the incident was actually was due to the environment variable KUBE_CONFIG set to the config path which had `live` context set
  - The terraform kubectl provider used to apply `kubectl_manifest` resources  uses environment variable `KUBECONFIG` and `KUBE_CONFIG_PATH`. But it has been found that it can also use variable `KUBE_CONFIG` causing the apply of certificate to the wrong cluster.

- **Review actions**:

- **Identified**: Pingdom alerted an LAA developer to some of their sites becoming unavailable. They reported this to CP team via Slack #ask-cloud-platform, and the messages were spotted by on-call engineers

- **Impact**:
  - Sites affected:
    - 2 production sites were unavailable:
      - laa-fee-calculator-production.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
      - legal-framework-api.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    - 3 production sites had minor issues - unavailable on domains that only MOJ staff use
    - 46 non-production sites were unavailable on domains that only MOJ staff use
  - Impact on users was negligible. The 2 sites that external users would have experienced the unavailability are typically used by office staff, for generally non-urgent work, whereas this incident occurred during the weekend.

- **Impact**: All ingress resources using the *apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk have mismatched certificates.

- **Context**:
  - Occurred immediately following an upgrade to the default certificate of "live" clusters (PR here: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ingress-controller/pull/20)
  - The change amended the default certificate in the `live-1` cluster to `*.apps.manager.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`.

- **Resolution**:
  - The immediate repair was simple: perform an inline edit of the default certificate in `live-1`. Replacing the word `manager` with `live-1` i.e. reverting the faulty change.
  - Further investigation ensued, finding the cause of the incident was actually an underlying bug in the infrastructure apply pipeline used to perform a `terraform apply` against manager.
  - This bug had been around from the creation of the pipeline but had never surfaced.
  - The pipeline uses an environment variable named `KUBE_CTX` to context switch between clusters. This works for resources using the `terraform provider`, however, not for `null_resources`, causing the change in the above PR to apply to the wrong cluster.

  - Provide guidance on namespace to namespace traffic - using network policy not ingress (and advertise it to users) Ticker [#3082](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3082)
  - Monitoring the cert - Kubehealthy monitor key things including cert. Could replace several of the integration tests that take longer. Ticket [#3044](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3044)
  - Canary app should have #high-priority-alerts after 2 minutes if it goes down. DONE in [PR #5126](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/pull/5126)
  - Fix the pipeline: in the [cloud-platform-cli](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-cli), create an assertion to ensure the cluster name is equal to the terraform workspace name. To prevent the null-resources acting on the wrong cluster. PR exists
  - Created a [ticket](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3084) to migrate all terraform null_resources within our modules to [terraform kubectl provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gavinbunney/kubectl/latest/docs)
  - Created a [ticket](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3083) to set terraform kubernetes credentials dynamically (at executing time)
  - Fix the pipeline: Before the creation of Terraform resources, add a function in the cli to perform a `kubectl context` switch to the correct cluster. PR exists

```kind Ingress: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": Post https://modsec01-nx-modsec-admission.ingress-controllers.svc:443/networking/v1beta1/ingresses?timeout=10s: x509: certificate is valid for modsec01-nx-controller-admission, modsec01-nx-controller-admission.ingress-controllers.svc, not modsec01-nx-modsec-admission.ingress-controllers.svc```

- **Impact**: It blocked all ingress API calls, so no new ingresses could be created, nor changes to current ingresses could be deployed, which included all user application deployments.

- **Context**:
  - Occurred immediately following an upgrade to the ModSec Ingress-controller module v3.33.0, which apparently successfully deployed
  - It caused any new ingress or changes to current ingresses to be blocked by the ModSec Validation webhook

- **Identified**: CP team member did 'terraform destroy components', intending it to destroy a test cluster, but it was on Manager cluster by mistake. Was immediately aware of the error.

- **Impact**:
  - Users couldn't create or change their namespace definitions or AWS resources, due to Concourse being down

- **Resolution**:
  - Manager cluster was recreated.
  - During this we encountered a certificate issue with Concourse, so it was restored manually. The terraform had got out of date for the Manager cluster.
  - Route53 zones were hard-coded and had to be [changed manually](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/pull/1162/files).

- **Actions following review**:
  - Spike ways to avoid applying to wrong cluster - see 3 options above. Ticket [#3016](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3016)
  - Try ‘Prevent destroy’ setting on R53 zone - Ticket [#2899](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/2899)
  - Disband the cloud-platform-concourse repository. This includes Service accounts, and pipelines. We should split this repository up and move it to the infra/terraform-concourse repos. Ticket [#3017](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3017)
  - Manager needs to use our PSPs instead of eks-privilege - this has already been done.

- **Time to repair**: 0h 15m

- **Time to resolve**: 1h 30m

- **Identified**: Periods of downtime while the cloud-platform team was applying per Availability Zone instance groups for worker nodes change in live-1. Failures caused mainly due to termination of a group of 9 nodes and letting kops to handle the cycling of pods, which took very long time for the new containers to be created in the new node group.

- **Impact**:
  - Some users noticed cycling of pods but taking a long time for the containers to be created.
  - Prometheus/alertmanager/kibana health check failures.
  - Users noticed short-lived pingdom alerts & health check failures.

- **Context**:
  - kops node group (nodes-1.16.13) updated minSize from 25 to 18 nodes and ran kops update cluster --yes, this terminated 9 nodes from existing worker node  group (nodes-1.16.13).
  - Pods are in pending status for a long time waiting to be scheduled in the new nodes.
  - Teams using their own ingress-controller have 1 replica for non-prod namespaces, causing some pingdom alerts & health check failures.

- **Time to repair**: 0h 38m

- **Time to resolve**: 3h 14m

- **Identified**: Some components of our production kubernetes cluster (live-1) were accidentally deleted, this caused some services running on cloud-platform gone down.

- **Impact**:
  - Some users could not access services running on the Cloud Platform.
  - Prometheus/alertmanager/grafana is not accessible.
  - kibana is not accessible.
  - Cannot create new certificates.

- **Context**:
  - Test cluster deletion script triggered to delete a test cluster, kube context incorrectly targeted the live-1 cluster and deleted some cloud-platform components.
  - Components include default ingress-controller, prometheus-operator, logging, cert-manager, kiam and external-dns. As ingress-controller gone down some users could not access services running on the Cloud Platform.
  - Formbuilder services not accessible even after ingress-controller is restored.
  - Timeline: [Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmhFcLkOEmyvN2E7PwUdo8l2O9EDpVx7c8-4d9pMBSg/edit#heading=h.ttkde0ugh32m) for the incident.
  - Slack thread: [Slack thread](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1600710001173700) for the incident.

- **Resolution**:
  - Team prioritised to restore default ingress controller, ingress-controller has a dependency of external-dns to update route53 records with
  new NLB and kiam for providing AWSAssumeRole for external-dns, these components (ingress-controller, external-dns and kiam) got restored successfully. Services start to come back up.
  - Formbuilder services are still pointing to the old NLB (network load balancer before ingress got replaced), reason for this is route53 TXT records was set incorrect owner field, so external-dns couldn't update the new NLB information in the A record. Team fixed the owner information in the TXT record, external DNS updated formbuilder route53 records to point to new NLB. Formbuilder services is up and running.
  - Team did target apply to restore remaining components.
  - Apply pipleine run to restore all the certificates, servicemonitors and prometheus-rules from the [environment repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments).

### Incident on 2020-09-07 12:54 - All users are unable to create new ingress rules

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2020-09-07 12:39
  - Incident declared 2020-09-07 12:54
  - Resolved 2020-09-07 15:56

- **Time to repair**: 3h 02m

- **Time to resolve**: 3h 17m

- **Identified**: The Ingress API refused 100% of POST requests.

- **Impact**:
  - If a user were to provision a new service, they would be unable to create an ingress into the cluster.

- **Context**:
  - [Version 0.1.0](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-teams-ingress-controller/compare/0.0.9...0.1.0) of the [teams ingress controller module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-teams-ingress-controller) enabled the creation of a `validationwebhookconfiguration` resource.
  - By enabling this option we created a single point of failure for all ingress-controller pods in the `ingress-controller` namespace.
  - A new 0.1.0 ingress controller failed to create in the "live-1" cluster due to AWS resource limits.
  - Validation webhook stopped new rules from creating, with the error:
    ```
    Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "ingress.yaml": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": Post offender-categorisation-prod-nx-controller-admission.ingress-controllers.svc:443/extensions/v1beta1/ingresses?timeout=30s: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
    ```
  - Initial investigation thread: https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1599478794246900
  - Incident declared: https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1599479640251900

- **Resolution**:
    The team manually removed the all the additional admission controllers created by 0.1.0. They then removed the admission webhook from the module and created a new release (0.1.1). All ingress modules currently on 0.1.0 were upgraded to the new release 0.1.1.

### Incident on 2020-08-25 11:26 - Connectivity issues with eu-west-2a

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2020-08-25 11:01
  - Incident declared 2020-08-25 11:26
  - Resolved 2020-08-25 12:11

- **Time to repair**: 0h 45m

- **Time to resolve**: 1h 10m

- **Identified**: The AWS  Availability Zones `eu-west-2a`, which contain some of our kubernetes nodes had an outage. API latency was elevated, some EC2 became unreachable and overall connectivity was unstable.

- **Impact**:
  - Two kubernetes nodes became unreachable
  - No new node could be launched in eu-west-2a
  - Kubernetes had issues talking to some of these nodes, preventing some API calls to succeed (Pods were not terminating)
  - New pods were not able to pull their Docker images.

- **Context**:
  - Pods and Nodes sitting in other Availability Zones (b & c) were not impacted
  - Slack threads: [Issue detected](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1598351210195200), [Incident Declared](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1598351210195200),
  - We now have 25 pods in the cluster, instead of 21

- **Resolution**:
    The incident was mitigated by deploying more 2-4 nodes in healthy Availability Zones, manually deleting the non-responding pods, and terminating the impacted nodes

### Incident on 2020-08-14 11:01 - Ingress-controllers crashlooping

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2020-08-14 10:43
  - Incident declared 2020-08-14 11:01
  - Resolved 2020-08-14 11:38

- **Time to repair**: 0h 37m

- **Time to resolve**: 0h 55m

- **Identified**: There are 6 replicas of the ingress-controller pod and 2 out of the 6 were crashlooping. A restart of the pods did not resolve the issue. As per a normal runbook process, a recycle of all pods was required. However after restarting pods 4 and 5, they also started to crashloop. The risk was when restarting pods 5 and 6 -  all 6 pods could be down and all ingresses down for the cluster.

- **Impact**:
  - Increased risk for all ingresses failing in the cluster if all 6 ingress-controller pods are in a crashloop state.

- **Context**:
  - 2 of the 6 ingress-controller pods crashlooping, after restart of 4 pods, 4 out of 6 pods crashlooping.
  - Issue was with the leader ingress-controller pod (which was not identified or restarted yet) and exhausting the shared memory.
    - After a restart of the leader ingress-controller pod, all other pods reverted back to a ready/running state.
    - Timeline : [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxKwC1B_pnlPbysS0zotbXMKyZcUDmDtnGbEyIHGvgQ/edit#heading=h.z3py6eydx4qu](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxKwC1B_pnlPbysS0zotbXMKyZcUDmDtnGbEyIHGvgQ/edit#heading=h.z3py6eydx4qu)

- **Resolution**:
    A restart of the leader ingress-controller pod was required so the other pods in the replica-set could connect and get the latest nginx.config file.

### Incident on 2020-08-07 16:39 - Master node provisioning failure

  - Incident declared 2020-08-07 16:39

- **Time to repair**: 0h 38m

- **Time to resolve**: 33h 15m (during support hours 10:00-17:00 M-F)

- **Identified**: Routine replacement of a master node failed because AWS did not have any c4.4xlarge instances available in the relevant availability zone.

- **Impact**:
  - Increased risk because the cluster was running on 2 out of 3 master nodes, for a brief period

- **Context**:
  - Lack of availability of a given instance type is not a failure mode for which we have planned
  - In theory, if a problem occurs which eventually kills each master node in turn, and if instances of the right type are not available in at least 2 availability zones, this could bring down the whole cluster.

- **Resolution**:
  - A new c4.4xlarge node *was* successfully (and automatically) launched approx. 40 minutes after we saw the problem
  - We replaced all our master nodes with c5.4xlarge instances, which (currently) have better availability
  - We and AWS are still investigating longer-term and more reliable fixes

- **Time to repair**: 5h 8m

- **Time to resolve**: 9h 16m (during support hours 10:00-17:00)

- **Identified**: Integration tests failed for cert-manager, apply pipeline failed showing it doesnot have permissions and
 divergence pipeline shows drift for live-1 components

- **Impact**:
  - Increased risk for cluster failure because some of the components do not have the correct configuration needed for the `live-1` production cluster

- **Context**:
  - One of the engineers was creating a test EKS cluster and ran `terraform apply` on EKS components
  - Without fully aware of the current cluster context, the `terraform apply` for EKS test cluster components has been applied to the `live-1` kops cluster
  - This has changed the configuration of several resources in the `live-1` cluster
  - Timeline: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrABxeHLMOnoM4yYoCi9N4N4zRY1SK1hTjrZ9s05zuc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrABxeHLMOnoM4yYoCi9N4N4zRY1SK1hTjrZ9s05zuc/edit?usp=sharing)

- **Time to repair**: 0h 30m

- **Time to resolve**: 5h 09m (during support hours 10:00-17:00)

- **Identified**: After an upgrade of the Nginx ingresses, support for legacy TLS was dropped.

- **Impact**:
  - IE11 users could not access any services running on the Cloud Platform
  - A few teams came forward with the issue :
    - LAA
    - Correspondence Tool
    - Prisoner Money

- **Context**:
  - After an upgrade of the Nginx Helm chart v1.24.0 to v1.35
  - The current version of Nginx has deprecated support for TLS 1.3 and lower
  - The issue was spotted on IE11 browsers
  - Timeline: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCf1WT82IlBYWozWN_FXZqL5h0KUcul_QAkxE84YDw0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCf1WT82IlBYWozWN_FXZqL5h0KUcul_QAkxE84YDw0/edit?usp=sharing)

### Incident on 2020-02-25 10:58

- **Key events**
  - Fault occurs 2020-02-25 07:32
  - Team aware 2020-02-25 07:36
  - Incident declared 2020-02-25 10:58
  - Resolved 2020-02-25 17:07

- **Time to repair**: 4h 9m

- **Time to resolve**: 7h (during support hours 10:00-17:00)

- **Identified**: During an upgrade, new masters were not coming up correctly (missing calico networking and other pods)

- **Impact**:
  - Degraded kubernetes API performance (because some API calls were being directed to non-functioning masters)
  - Increased risk of cluster failure, because we were running on a single master during the incident

- **Context**:
  - Upgrading from kubernetes 1.13.12 to 1.14.10, kops 1.13.2 to 1.14.1
  - The first master was replaced fine, but the second didn't have calico and some other essential pods, and was not functioning correctly
  - Attempting to roll back the upgrade, every new master exhibited the same problem
  - Slack thread: [https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1582628309085600](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1582628309085600)

- **Resolution**:
    The `kube-system` namespace has a label, `openpolicyagent.org/webhook: ignore` This label tells the Open Policy Agent (OPA) that pods are allowed to run in this namespace on the master nodes. Somehow, this label got removed, so the OPA was preventing pods from running on the new master nodes, as each one came up, so the new master was unable to launch essential pods such as `calico` and `fluentd`.

### Incident on 2020-02-18 14:13 UTC

- **Key events**
  - Fault occurs 2020-02-18 14:13
  - Incident declared 2020-02-18 14:23
  - Resolved 2020-02-18 14:59

- **Time to repair**: 0h 36m

- **Time to resolve**: 0h 46m

- **Identified**: Pingdom reported that Prometheus was down (prometheus.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk).

- **Impact**:
  - The prometheus dashboard was unavailable for everyone, for the whole duration of the incident.
  - Between 2020-02-18 14:22 and 2020-02-18 14:26, prometheus could not receive metrics.

- **Context**:
  - Although the Prometheus URL was unreachable, Grafana and Alertmanager were resolving.
  - There seemed to be an issue preventing requests to reach the prometheus pods.
  - Disk space and other resources, the usual suspects, were ruled out as the cause.
  - The domain name amd ingress were both valid.
  - Slack thread: <https: mojdt.slack.com archives C514ETYJX p1582035803248800>

- **Resolution**:
    We suspect an intermittent & external networking issue to be the cause of this outage.

- **Identified**: Pingdom reported Concourse (concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) down.

- **Context**:
  - One of the engineers was deleting old clusters (he ran `terraform destroy`) and he wasn't fully aware in which _terraform workspace_ was working on. Using `terraform destroy`, EKS nodes/workers were deleted from the manager cluster.
  - Slack thread: <https: mojdt.slack.com archives C514ETYJX p1581508273080900>

  - **Resolution**: Using terraform (`terraform apply -var-file vars/manager.tfvars` specifically) the cluster nodes where created and the infrastructure aligned? to the desired terraform state

## About this incident log

The purpose of publishing this incident log:

- for the Cloud Platform team to learn from incidents
- for the Cloud Platform team and its stakeholders to track incident trends and performance
- because we operate in the open

Definitions:

- The words used in the timeline of an incident: fault occurs, team becomes aware (of something bad), incident declared (the team acknowledges and has an idea of the impact), repaired (system is fully functional), resolved (fully functional and future failures are prevented)
- *Incident time* - The start of the failure (Before March 2020 it was the time the incident was declared)
- *Time to Repair* - The time between the incident being declared (or when the team became aware of the fault) and when service is fully restored. Only includes [Hours of Support](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#hours-of-support).
- *Time to Resolve* - The time between when the fault occurs and when system is fully functional (and include any immediate work done to prevent future failures). Only includes [Hours of Support](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#hours-of-support). This is a broader metric of incident response performance, compared to Time to Repair.
