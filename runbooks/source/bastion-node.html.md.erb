# Create and access bastion node.

The traditional method of node access would be to SSH in via a bastion. We used this to access kops cluster nodes, this involves a shared ssh key. 
We no longer have this bastion node, but in-case if cloud-platform team would like to have a bastion node on a VPC, this run book can be used to create and access a bastion inside an existing VPC.

## Create bastion node

To create a bastion node, use the Terraform module to create a bastion inside an existing VPC. Follow the below steps to apply the basion module.

Step 1:

Copy the blow module code in this [eks main.tf][eks-main] file. It depends on the [aws_route53_zone][route-53-zone] of the cluster

```
module "bastion" {
  source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-bastion?ref=1.5.0"

  vpc_name            = terraform.workspace
  route53_zone        = aws_route53_zone.cluster.name
  cluster_domain_name = "${terraform.workspace}.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk."
  depends_on = [
    aws_route53_zone.cluster
  ]
}

```

Step 2:

In the bastion module update the below arguments:

 - vpc_name: Update the name of the VPC, you like to create the bastion module on, normally it would be the terraform workspace name
 - route53_zone: This will be the name of the route53 zone created for the cluster in [here][route-53-zone]
 - cluster_domain_name: This will be the cluster domain name.

Step 3:

Now it's time to apply the module, we change the directory to [terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks) and follow below terraform workflow:

```
terraform init
terraform workspace select <WorkspaceName>
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Once terraform finishes you should be able to view the bastion node in the Amazon EC2 console.


## Access bastion node

Make sure your public key is added to this [authorized_keys][auth-keys] file

Once the bastion is created successfully and the key is added to the authorized_keys file, ssh to bastion instance:

In the Amazon EC2 console, on the Instances page, search using `${CLUSTER_NAME}`to locate the bastion instance (`bastion.<cluster_name>.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`). Use Public DNS (IPv4) In the description of the Instance to login into bastion as below:


```bash
ssh -A admin@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -p 50422
```
