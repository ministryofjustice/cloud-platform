There is a [lambda function] in place which runs weekly and revokes public access for all our S3 Buckets. If we want grant public access to S3 buckets they must be [added as exceptions within module definion] followed by `terraform apply`. It should also be followed the instructions described within the [S3 module "Usage" section]
