# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This [lambda function] created by the security team runs weekly, and revokes public access for all our S3 Buckets.

The lambda function has a `S3_EXCEPTION` environment variable which stores a list of S3 buckets to ignore. To enable public access to a bucket, it must be added to this list.

The easiest way to do this is to [edit the environment variable] directly via the aws console.

The function uses a substring test to see if the current bucket name appears in the `S3_EXCEPTION` string, so you can use any separator you want when you add the new bucket name to the variable.

Note: If we create s3 bucket as private and try to change to public later, terraform apply is failing with "Error: Error putting S3 ACL: AccessDenied: Access Denied". 
Running Terraform apply again will say no changes to make, but you will notice that the bucket is not chaned as public. There is an open [terraform issue] relaed to this error.
