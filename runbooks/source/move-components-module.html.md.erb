# Moving `components` modules into `core`

In order to migrate a terraform module from `components` into `core`, there are a number of steps that need to be taken in order to make sure the process runs smoothly. From a high level, the terraform module needs to be moved and then tested in a test cluster.

The aim is to make sure that when a terraform plan is run against both `core` and `compoents` after the MTM tool is ran, there should be no terraform changes.

There is a pipeline in Concourse that accepts `$CLUSTER_NAME`, `$MODULE_NAME` and `$RESOURCE` setting these and running the pipeline will migrate that module/resource on the cluster specified. Resources can be passed as comma-seperated strings. Getting a list of resources to migrate is a manual process that requires you to read through the terraform files in `components`. Some can be found by tracing back dependencies, others should be obvious via there name. The name format for resources follow `$resource_type.$resource name` so `resource "kubernetes_storage_class" "storageclass"` becomes `kubernetes_storage_class.storageclass`, you can double check this by running `terraform state list`.

If you need to upgrade the `mtm` cli, you can update the `$MTM_VERSION` parameter in the pipeline.

## Notes on the pipeline

The pipeline takes the following arguments:

* `cluster_name` - Name of the cluster to target e.g. `cp-0001-0001`.
* `module_name` - Name of the module to target e.g. `cert_manager`.
* `resource` - Name of the resource to target e.g. `kubectl_manifest.prometheus_operator_crds`, accepts a comma-separated list for multiple resources.
* `flagged_resource` Name of flagged resource to target, this is used for resources that need to be pulled out of a module, accepts a comma-separated list for multiple resources.

Because of the way concourse variables work, none of the above can be blank. You can pass a dummy string in like `module.null` and the MTM tool will try to migrate a module/resource that doesn't exist.

## Process

1. Notify `#cloud-platform` that you are pausing concourse pipelines
2. Pause `bootstrap`, `live-2`, `manager` and `live` pipelines.
3. Raise a PR with migrated module
4. Log in to Concourse using `fly -t moj-cp login -c https://concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/`
5. Ensure you are in the `cloud-platform-terraform-concourse` directory.
6. Update pipelines with module and/or resource(s) name(s) and cluster name:
    `fly -t moj-cp set-pipeline --pipeline migrate-module --config migrate-module.yaml -v cluster_name=cp-0306-0730 -v module=tigera_calico -v resources=kubectl_manifest.calico_crds,http.calico_crds -v flagged_resources=module.null`
7. Run `migrate-module` pipeline from the Concourse UI.
8. Unpause pipeline environment-specific pipeline (e.g. live-2)
9. Re-run PR plan - the plan should show "No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration."
10. Re-run step 5-9 with the next environment (e.g. manager)
11. Get approval for the PR and merge.
12. Un-pause `live-2` and check for a clean apply
13. Repeat 9. with `manager` and `live`
14. Update #cloud-platform informing the team of the completed migration and that pipelines are unpaused.

## Disaster Recovery

If for some reason something goes wrong, then you can use the backed up state file to overwrite the remote.

Alternatively, all our tf state objects are versioned in S3 so you can restore a previous known working version from the AWS console.
