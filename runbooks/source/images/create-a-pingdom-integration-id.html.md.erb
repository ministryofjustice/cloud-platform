# Create a Pingdom integration id

The intention of this document is to provide brief instructions on how to create an integration id in Pingdom. For more information on integration ids, please refer to the [Pingdom documentation](https://help.pingdom.com/hc/en-us/articles/207081599-Webhooks-or-Slack-Integration)

Completing the following steps is necessary to support Cloud Platform user requests as detailed [here](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/monitoring-an-app/how-to-create-pingdom-checks.html#adding-slack-notification)
## How to create integration id (webhook)

This cannot be managed by Terraform and will need to be created manually. To continue any further, it is assumed you have the following:

- Access to the [Pingdom slack app](https://slack.com/apps/A0F814AV7-pingdom?next_id=0)
- Access to Pingdom

To create the webhook, perform the following:

- Sign into the mojds Slack [Pingdom app](https://mojdt.slack.com/apps/new/A0F814AV7-pingdom)
- Create a new configuration:

  1. Select the target slack channel
  2. Click 'Add Pingdom Integration'
  3. Locate the newly generated Webhook URL and copy to the clipboard. This will look similar to `https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxxx/xxxxxx/xxxxx`

- Sign into [Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com/app)
- Go to Settings cog in the side menu > `Integrations` > `Add integration`
- Fill in a suitable name for the integration and paste the generated webhook from the previous step
- Save integration

Now, it's a simple case of finding the `integrationid`, which can be found by clicking your newly created integration and making a note of the `integration=` in the URL.

eg:
```
https://my.pingdom.com/integrations/settings#integration=90679
```
