# Remove data from Elasticsearch

This runbook aims to guide you through purging specific logs/data from Elasticsearch. 

Let's assume in this guide that we are trying to delete all logs of the  `my-namespace-production` namespace, from the 01/02/2020

## Stop the breach first

If you're removing data from Elasticsearch, this is presumably because sensitive information has been logged by mistake.
Please ensure that the underlying problem has been fixed, and no more sensitive data is going to be logged by the same
application, before spending time removing what's already there.

## Things to know 

An important thing to understand is the difference between an index and a document. 
An index contains documents. In our case, documents are log entries.

The current logging strategy is to have one index per day, containing all the daily logs.
All application logs are sent to that daily index, ex:  `logstash-2020.02.01`
If you want your query to cover all log data stored in the Elasticsearch cluster, you can use expression in the index like `logstash-2*`

Although it is possible to delete a whole index with a curator job, this guide will only cover the deletion of specific documents.

**Running `curl` queries has to be done from within the live-1 VPC.**

## Build your query

It is possible to reuse the body of a `search` query for a `delete` query.

Therefore, if we narrow down a search query to exactly what we want to delete, we've done most of the work.

Kibana offers a [webconsole](https://kibana.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/_plugin/kibana/app/kibana#/dev_tools/console) to test queries.

A standard query is : 

```
GET /logstash-2020.02.01/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
    }
  }
}
```

> Important note: `.keyword` forces elasticsearch to only return exact matches. Without it, you may end up deleting more than you wish


As a `curl` command, the query above would translate to: 

```
curl -XGET "https://search-cloud-platform-live-dibidbfud3uww3lpxnhj2jdws4.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/logstash-2020.02.01/_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
    }
  }
}'
```

Once the result of the search query exactly fits what you want to delete, carry on to the next step.

## Delete by query

A `POST` request against the `_delete_by_query` endpoint will delete all documents matching the query in the request's body. 

If we want to delete all logs from the `my-namespace-production` from 01/02/2020:

```
    curl -XPOST \
        https://search-cloud-platform-live-dibidbfud3uww3lpxnhj2jdws4.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/logstash-2020.02.01/_delete_by_query?pretty \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d'{"query":{"match":{"kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"}}}'
```

Here again, `.keyword` is essential.

To run the `curl` commands, you can `exec` into any of the pods(eg. fluentd-es) inside the cluster. You may have to install `curl`.

After executing the commands and removing the data, make sure to delete the pod as it will contain the search results of sensitve data 
you have queried using `curl`. A fluentd pod will be recreated automatically.

## Removing specific logs filtered by phrase

If you want to delete logs which has a certain phrase, you can use below queries.

Searching for a phrase "What is your name?" between certain dates, the `curl` command would look like

```

curl -XGET https://search-cloud-platform-live-dibidbfud3uww3lpxnhj2jdws4.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/logstash-2*/_search?pretty \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [],
      "filter": [
        {
          "multi_match": {
            "type": "phrase",
            "query": "What is your name?",
            "lenient": true
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "@timestamp": {
              "format": "strict_date_optional_time",
              "gte": "2020-06-13T12:19:24.804Z",
              "lte": "2020-07-14T15:19:24.804Z"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [],
      "must_not": []
    }
  }
}'

```

Deleting the logs which has a phrase "What is your name?" between certain dates, the `curl` command would look like

```
curl -XPOST https://search-cloud-platform-live-dibidbfud3uww3lpxnhj2jdws4.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/logstash-2*/_delete_by_query?pretty \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [],
      "filter": [
        {
          "multi_match": {
            "type": "phrase",
            "query": "What is your name?",
            "lenient": true
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "@timestamp": {
              "format": "strict_date_optional_time",
              "gte": "2020-06-13T12:19:24.804Z",
              "lte": "2020-07-14T15:19:24.804Z"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [],
      "must_not": []
    }
  }
}'

```

If you have complex search patterns used in kibana which you want to delete, 
 - narrow down the kibana search in the webconsole
 - click on the "Inspect"
 - In the popup search window, click on the tab "Request"
 - Copy and paste the object which mentions `"query": {` to the above curl command and modify dates as you need

 If you are searching for phrases which has single-quote characters, it may need special handling when adding those to the query.
