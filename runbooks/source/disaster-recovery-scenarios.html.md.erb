# Cloud Platform Disaster Recovery Scenarios

This section will document various scenarios that will create an incident. Each scenario will have an impact and restore process.

## Losing a Namespace

### Impact
A loss of a namespace will result in losing all resources within the namespace including ingress.

### Possible Cause
User error - Executing `kubectl delete ns my-namespace-dev`

```
kubectl get all -n my-namespace-dev
No resources found in my-namespace-dev namespace.
```
### Restore process
As long as the namespace is over 3 hours old, it can be recovered using Velero.

First step is to find the name of the most recent backup of the `allnamespacebackup` schedule:

```
velero backup get

NAME                                       STATUS      CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
velero-allnamespacebackup-00000000000000   Completed   2020-03-30 12:00:37 +0100 BST   29d       default            <none>
```
Using the backup name, you can now run a `Velero restore` command to restore the deleted namespace.

Restore command:

```
velero restore create <restore-name> --from-backup <backup-name> --include-namespaces <namespace> --wait
```

Example:

```
velero restore create my-namespace-dev-restore --from-backup velero-allnamespacebackup-00000000000000 --include-namespaces my-namespace-dev --wait
```

Once completed, you should be able to see the namespace and all resources recovered:

```
kubectl get all -n my-namespace-dev

NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pod1                   2/2     Running     0          1m

NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)      AGE
service/service1           ClusterIP   None             None          443/TCP      1m

NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/deployment1          1/1     1            1           1m

NAME                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/replicaset1          1         1         1       1m
```

## Losing a Kubernetes Component or Object

### Impact
A loss of a kubernetes object such as a deployment, secret and Namespace can result in an application not working correctly. A loss of a Kubernetes component such as kube-scheduler or kube-control-manager can result in the cluster not working correctly.

### Possible Cause
User error - Executing `kubectl delete deployment/my-deployment-name ns my-namespace-dev`

```
kubectl get deployment/my-deployment-name -n my-namespace-dev
Error from server (NotFound): deployments.extensions "my-deployment-name" not found.
```
### Restore process
As long as the namespace is over 3 hours old, it can be recovered using Velero.

First step is to find the name of the most recent backup of the schedule:

```
velero backup get

NAME                                       STATUS      CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE   LOCATION   SELECTOR
velero-backup-00000000000000              Completed   2020-03-30 12:00:37 +0100 BST     29d       default             <none>
```
Using the backup name, you can now run a `Velero restore` command to restore the deleted resource.

Restore command:

```
velero restore create <restore-name> --from-backup <backup-name> --include-namespaces <namespace> --wait
```

Example:

```
velero restore create restore-deployment --from-backup velero-backup-00000000000000 --selector=deployment-name --include-namespaces my-namespace-dev --wait
```

Once completed, you should be able to see the resources recovered:

```
kubectl get deployment/my-deployment-name -n my-namespace-dev

NAME                                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/my-deployment-name        1/1       1            1         1m

```

It's also possible to restore multiple objects/components with one command:
```
velero restore create --from-backup velero-backup-00000000000000 --include-resources component,service --namespace-mappings original-namespace:target-namespace --wait
```

## Losing the whole cluster

### Impact

Severity : HIGH

Likelihood: LOW

Losing the whole kubernetes cluster will result in all services not being available. This means all the
resources within all namespaces, networking, monitoring and logging systems.

### Possible Cause

Losing the whole cluster is less likely and the possible causes may vary.

User error - Deleting all EC2 instances of `<cluster-name>` from console by accident

The first sign of this happening is likely to be Pagerduty alarms to the high/low priority slack channels.

### How this plan is tested:

This way of restoring the whole cluster have been tested with below procedure

1. Create cluster using the [script](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/create-cluster.rb)
2. Deploy [starter pack](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-starter-pack) to replicate user namespaces
3. Take backup of the whole cluster using [velero](velero.html#velero-cluster-backups-and-disaster-recovery)
4. Destroy the cluster excluding the VPC using the [script](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/destroy-cluster.rb)
5. Create a cluster with the same name. That way velero can match the backup storage location
6. Restore the cluster from the backup taken in Step 3

### Assumptions
- VPC of the cluster is not deleted
- Not all Kubernetes resources are tested for Recovery
- Not all AWS resources are tested for reconnecting to application after restore
- Smoke tests are run excluding one for `live`
- Terraform state have been recreated

### Restore process
Any namespaces over 3 hours old can be recovered using Velero (newer namespaces might not have been backed up before the incident occurred).

Create the cluster with the **same** name from the [source code](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/create-cluster.rb)
and provide the existing `vpc-name`. This will link the velero backup locations to the lost cluster.

Find the name of the most recent backup of the `allnamespacebackup` schedule:

```
velero backup get

NAME                                       STATUS      CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
velero-allnamespacebackup-00000000000000   Completed   2020-03-30 12:00:37 +0100 BST   29d       default            <none>
```
Using the backup name, you can now run a `velero restore` command to restore the deleted namespace.

Restore command:

```
velero restore create <restore-name> --from-backup <backup-name> --wait
```

Example:

```
velero restore create my-namespace-dev-restore --from-backup velero-allnamespacebackup-00000000000000 --wait
```

Once completed, you should be able to see resources in all namespaces recovered.

Check the status of the restore and look for errors and warnings:

```
velero restore describe velero-allnamespacebackup-00000000000000-00000000000000
```

Check the logs of the restore:

```
velero restore logs velero-allnamespacebackup-00000000000000-00000000000000

```

### Restoring a Lost Cluster to a New One with a Different Name

To do this:
    - You need the cluster backup-location of the lost cluster
    - Lost cluster's backup-location name (it usually comes as `default`)
    - Lost cluster's backup name

Below are the restore steps:
- unset the backup-location of the new cluster: velero backup-location set --default=false
- create a .yaml file that contains details of the old cluster's backup-location in this format:
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: BackupStorageLocation
metadata:
    name: lost-cluster
    namespace: velero
    spec:
        provider: aws
    objectStorage:
        bucket: cloud-platform-velero-backups
        prefix: cp-0000-0000 #velero backup-location get (from the old cluster)
    config:
        region: eu-west-2

- kubectl apply -f file-name.yaml
- velero backup-location set lost-cluster --default=true
- velero restore create --from-backup velero-allnamespacebackup-timestamp #this refers to the lost cluster's backup name
- confirm the restore by:
    confirming the new cluster's default backup-location
```
running velero backup-location get
```

    confirm the new cluster now uses the lost cluster's backup name:
```
velero backup get
```

This is a makeshift for the time being.

## Deleted terraform state

Severity : low

Likelihood: medium

### Impact
Items removed from the terraform state are not physically destroyed but no longer managed by terraform. This means infrastructure is orphaned with no state.

For example, if you remove an AWS instance from the state, the AWS instance will continue running, but terraform plan will no longer see that instance.

### Possible Cause
User error - Executing `terraform state rm module.starter_pack.kubernetes_namespace.starter_pack`  will remove kubernetes starter_pack namespace from terraform state. When state is removed, running "terraform apply" will raise error, as terraform cannot track about existing resource and try to create new one.

```
terraform apply -target=module.starter_pack.kubernetes_namespace.starter_pack

Error: namespaces "starter-pack" already exists
```

### Restore process

In order to regain control of resource removed from terraform state, we will use the [import command](https://www.terraform.io/cli/import) to recover the metadata for this resource. Import requires a resource address and the resource ID. The resource address is a combination of the resource type and resource name.

```
terraform import module.starter_pack.kubernetes_namespace.starter_pack starter-pack

```

The import command creates a new state file pulling in information about the specified kubernetes_namespace.

```
module.starter_pack.kubernetes_namespace.starter_pack: Importing from ID "starter-pack"...
module.starter_pack.kubernetes_namespace.starter_pack: Refreshing state... [id=starter-pack]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

Now running terraform apply after import, will not raise any error.

```
terraform apply -target=module.starter_pack.kubernetes_namespace.starter_pack

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
Best to do this in a feature branch.

### Recovering more complex scenarios

There are scenarios, where terraform state is corrupted or terraform state is removed for the whole module.
Executing `terraform state rm module.starter_pack`, will remove all resources in "starter_pack" module from terraform state.

```
terraform plan -target=module.starter_pack

Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

In this scenario, terraform state can be restored from the remote_state stored in the terraform backend S3 bucket.

For example [eks/core/components](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components) state is stored in "aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components" s3 bucket as defined [here-eks](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components/main.tf/#L5-L14).

Access the S3 bucket where the effected terraform state is stored. From the list of terraform.tfstate file versions, identify the file before the state got removed and download as terraform.tfstate. Upload the file again, this will set uploaded file as latest version.

#### Recovery Steps:

- Navigate to AWS console > switch region to eu-west-1 (not necessary)> cloud-platform-terraform-state/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components>your-cluster>terraform.tfstate
- download the state file with this command -- aws s3 cp s3://cloud-platform-terraform-state/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components/your-cluster/terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate
- Upload the terraform.tfstate file back to the bucket -- aws s3 cp terraform.tfstate s3://cloud-platform-terraform-state/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components/cp-1712-1719/terraform.tfstate
- Reran terraform plan -target=module.starter-pack and got No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration. as indicated in the documentation.

Now running terraform plan will show, infrastructure is up-to-date.

```
terraform plan -target=module.starter_pack

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.
```

### Resolving a PartiallyFailed backup alert

A backup may fail and trigger an alert in `lower-priority-alerts`. inspect the backup job:

```
kubectl get backup -n velero | grep -C 30 YYYYMMDD
```

You identify the failed backup `phase: PartiallyFailed` and there will also by an `errors` field with a count.

To understand the cause of the alert pull out the error messages from the velero pod from kibana:

```
kubernetes.pod_name: velero-<container-id> and log: "level=error"
```

Sometimes the cause of the alert can be genuine, for instance a volume may have been removed (pod restart during a backup):

```
level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=velero/velero-allnamespacebackup-20231120090023 error="error getting volume info: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume 'vol-08d317558ab5bd46b' does not exist.\n\tstatus code: 400
```
