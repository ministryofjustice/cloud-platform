Incident response exercises are run with the aid of the Panda Cyber team. To book in an exercise contact Panda Cyber via their Slack channel `#ask-panda-cyber`.

Incident response exercises are run at least annually. When this document comes up for review, the Cloud Platform team will check that an incident response exercise has been run in the last 12 months, if not a new exercise will be scheduled.

## Location of Exercise Reviews

Exercise reviews and recommendations are stored in the Cloud Platform team Security folder.

## Exercise Scenarios
