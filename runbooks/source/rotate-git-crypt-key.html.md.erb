# Git-crypt

We use `git-crypt` for securing secrets committed to `git`. It uses a symmetric encryption key which is then encrypted for users using their GPG keys.

## Adding new user to the keyring

1. Ask the user (Slack, email, keyserver, etc) for their public key and import it into your keyring:

    ```
    gpg --import <<EOF
    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

    -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    EOF
    ```

2. Using KeyID/email trust the key as *"5 = I trust ultimately"*:

```
gpg --edit-key "my-name@digital.justice.gov.uk" trust quit
```

3. Create a new branch inside the git repository where user is going to be added:

```
git checkout -b add-alejandro-gpg
```

4. Use git-crypt CLI to add the user:

```
git-crypt add-gpg-user my-name@digital.justice.gov.uk
```

5. Push the branch and create a PR:

```
git push origin add-alejandro-gpg
```

## Rotating the git-crypt key

When rotating the `git-crypt` symmetric key, you should follow the steps below:

#### 1. Ensure you have unlocked the repository:

```
git-crypt unlock
```

#### 2. Make a list of the current users:

- for every file found, extract its filename minus the suffix, which corresponds to the user's key id

```
ls .git-crypt/keys/default/0/*.gpg | xargs -I{} -- basename {} .gpg > git-crypt-users
```

#### 3.  Make a list of the encrypted files:

- for every currently encrypted file, extract its path, relative to the root of the repository

```
git-crypt status -e | awk '{ print $2; }' > git-crypt-files
```

#### 4.  Remove `git-crypt` configuration:

```
rm -rf .git-crypt .git/git-crypt
```

#### 5.  Re-initialise `git-crypt`,

```
git-crypt init
```

- make sure you have all the users' keys,

```
cat git-crypt-users | xargs -I{} gpg --recv-key {}
```

- and add all the users back,

```
cat git-crypt-users | xargs -I{} git-crypt add-gpg-user -n --trusted {}
```

- At this point, your git index will have a number of pending changes, do not commit them yet.

#### 6.  Re-encrypt all the secrets: the list of secrets was extracted in `git-crypt-files` (see step 2. above). Since the master encryption key is being rotated, all of the secrets that have been encrypted with it *must* be rotated. Once finished, you can add the files to the index

```
cat git-crypt-files | xargs git add
```

#### 7. Commit your changes. One way to check that the files in the git index are properly encrypted before you commit your changes is like so:

```
git show :<path-to-file>
```

- or after committing (and before you've pushed):

```
git show HEAD:<path-to-file>
```

- where `<path-to-file>` is either absolute from the base of the git repo or relative (eg.: `git show:./my-secret-file.yaml`)

- You should see binary output which begins with `^@GITCRYPT^@`.

Note: If you need to `checkout` an older commit, branch, tag etc., make sure to `git-crypt lock` your repository beforehand in order to avoid a broken local working directory. Once you've locked and checked out the desired revision, you can `git-crypt unlock`.
