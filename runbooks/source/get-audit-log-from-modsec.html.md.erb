# Get an audit log from modsec

On occasion users may need you to provide them with audit log information on an modsec event from our ingress-controllers. This information may be sensitive so it can't be placed in our org-wide Elasticsearch cluster. You'll need to fetch this information from the pod that generated the log.


## How do I check the audit log

As mentioned above, the audit log cannot be placed into Elasticsearch so you'll need the following:

- A Kibana event from the user. A request will come into the ask-cloud-platform channel asking something like:

```
Good afternoon, could I ask for the detailed logs for this block from ModSecurity, please?
https://kibana.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/_plugin/kibana/app/kibana#/doc/fb2e6550-0186-11ec-a2cf-6b21[…]lue:0),time:(from:now-3h,to:now))
(I need to find out which rules triggered the block, it has 2 critical fails)

example: https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C57UPMZLY/p1630936971082200
```

- The Kibana event above should provide you with the following key information

```
 modsec pod name: This will allow you to hone in on the correct pod.
 unique-id: This is a hash of the event in question, e.g. 5266c62ecf75109ee3083dcc6e13489u
```

- Kubectl access to the live cluster and access to the `ingress-controllers` namespace.

## Exec into the pod

From the Kibana event you should now know the modsec pod name, exec into that pod:

```bash
kubectl -n ingress-controllers exec -it <insert-modsec-podname-here> sh
```

## Perform a search for the unique-id (obtained from the Kibana entry)

The audit log structure is extrememly convoluted. Use the following commands to identify the log file name:

```bash
# An example
export UNIQUEID=5266c62ecf75109ee3083dcc6easda234
cd /var/log/audit
find . -name "*" | xargs grep -iEl ${UNIQUEID} | xargs ls -lrt
```

This should return a filepath leading to the filename containing your event. We can take the output of this command and perform a grep for the log entry.

```bash
grep ${UNIQUEID} ./20210906-1125/20210906-112550-5266c62ecf75109ee3083dcc6easda234
```

Which should return the event.
 
If you want to copy the filtered events of a particilar date e.g.24/11/2021 to a folder and download to the local machine to extract the data, use the commands in bash
 ```bash
 cd /var/log/audit/20211124
 find . -name "*" | xargs grep -iEl "String or hostname to search" > list.txt
 mkdir copy
 for file in $(<list.txt); do cp "$file" ./copy; done
 ```

This should copy the filtered folders and files into the `copy` folder

Exit the modsec pod and from your machine, enter the below command
```bash
 kubectl -n ingress-controllers cp <modsec-pod-name>:/var/log/audit/20211124/copy .                     
```

If you want to send the log data to a user, make sure you filter the data specific to that application and encrypt the file.
From mac, you can use gpgkeychain to encrypt the file using the receiver's public key before sending it to the user.
