In the [build pipeline], you will sometimes see errors like this:

```
Command: cd namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/jason-lab/resources; terraform apply -auto-approve failed.

Error: Error locking state: Error acquiring the state lock: ConditionalCheckFailedException: The conditional request failed
    status code: 400, request id: 8F9C5H04HLD0TVN4V0PQIRRMFBVV4KQNSO5AEMVJF66Q9ASUAAJG
```

If you see repeated failures trying to acquire the lock on the same namespace,
it probably means the lock record has been left in place by mistake, because a
previous run failed to release the lock when it should have.

To fix this, you need to delete the lock record.

## Command-line method

Save this code as a script.

`delete-state-lock.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

NAMESPACE=$1

PREFIX=cloud-platform-terraform-state/cloud-platform-environments

for key in "${PREFIX}/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/${NAMESPACE}/terraform.tfstate-md5" "${PREFIX}/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/${NAMESPACE}/terraform.tfstate"; do
  json='{"LockID":{"S":"'${key}'"}}'

  aws dynamodb delete-item \
    --region eu-west-1 \
    --table-name cloud-platform-environments-terraform-lock \
    --key $json
done
```

Invoke it like this:

```bash
./delete-state-lock.sh hmpps-book-video-link-prod
```

## AWS Console method

1. Go to the [dynamodb] page of the AWS web console (NB: the relevant table is in the `eu-west-1` region)
2. Click on the [cloud-platform-environments-terraform-lock] table, and then the `Items` tab
3. Click `Add filter`
4. Enter `LockID` as the filter attribute, and change `String, =` to `String, contains` as the filter criteria
5. Enter the namespace name as the string value to match, and click `Start search`

When you find the relevant lock records, delete them. Terraform will recreate
any missing records the next time it tries to acquire the lock for that
terraform state file.

## Terraform command

To force unlock, you can run this terraform command using the `LockID`

```bash
terraform force-unlock <LockID>
```
