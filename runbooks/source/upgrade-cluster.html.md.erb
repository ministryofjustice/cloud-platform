# Upgrade a cluster

## Planning

When you start working on an upgrade ticket:

- Check which versions are available to upgrade to
- Check whether the current cluster is upgradeable to that version (skipping a major version is not recommended)
- Check the release notes of the kops and kubernetes version for any breaking changes
- Check and add notes of every CHANGELOG.md of kops between the current kops version of your cluster to the version you want to upgrade to
- Check and add notes of every CHANGELOG.md of kubernetes between the current kubernetes version of your cluster to the version you want to upgrade to (there might be changes between minor versions which might not be mentioned in the major version CHANGELOG)
- Review the CHANGELOG notes with another member of the team (check for breaking changes, deprecations and suggested alternatives for any addons/components)

## Pre-requisites

- Your GPG key must be added to the [infrastructure repo] so that you are able to run `git-crypt unlock`

- You have the [AWS CLI] profile `moj-cp` with suitable credentials

- You have [docker] installed

### Setup environment

Setup the environment variables listed in [example.env.create-cluster] in the [infrastructure repo].

### Run the integration tests

Run the [integration test pipeline] and wait for the tests to pass. This will ensure the live cluster is functioning as expected.

### Sanity checks

Ensure Concourse pipelines are green, and pause all of them.

Take a snapshot of

- all non-running pods; you can do this by running `kubectl get pods -A | grep -v "Running"`.
- triggered Prometheus alarms; take a screenshot of the current triggered alarms.

### Run a shell in the tools image

The cloud platform [tools image] has all the software required to update a cluster.

The image will need updates for new client tool versions, see [this PR](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-tools-image/pull/34) for an example. Make the required changes and create a new release (which will use a github action to push the new image to DockerHub).

From a local copy of the `cloud-platform-infrastructure repository`, run the following command (after editing the `makefile` to ensure that you're using the new version of the tools image):

```bash
make tools-shell
```

## Run the upgrade

### Authenticate to the cluster

Create the file `~/.kube/config` in your tools-image container by running:

```bash
kops export kubecfg XXXXXXX.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

### Update the live cluster manifest

Open the cloud-platform-infrastructure repository and make the following changes to the `kops/live-1.yaml` manifest:

  - The Kubernetes release version, ensuring it is supported by Kops - verify on the [kops releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases) page.
  - The AMI in each instance group. This can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/channels/stable)

Make the same changes to the template file [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-kops/blob/main/templates/kops.yaml.tpl), and create a new release of the module.

The new release must be also referenced in our [definition/instance file](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/f4d74e232cab7d69d91abdc4578c73d6344ecc4e/terraform/cloud-platform/main.tf#L60).

### Push changes to kops state

Run the following to push the above changes to the kops state store in S3.

`kops update cluster`

Review the changes before committing with:

`kops update cluster -yes`

### Perform a rolling-update

This is a delicate procedure, so this article will proceed with extreme caution.

First, get the instance groups:

`kops get ig`

Update each master individually:

`kops rolling-update cluster --instance-group <master-instance-group> (--yes)`

Kops will safely eject the instance from the cluster and bring back a new one.

Once the first new master is in a `ready` state, run the fast integration tests with:

```
cd cloud-platform-infrastructure/smoke-tests
make test-fast
```

This will take around 30 seconds, and all the tests should pass.

> During an upgrade, we had an issue where kube-system namespace label got removed, which resulted in the OPA webhook blocking us from applying daemonsets to the master node. If the above `make test-fast` fails for that reason, apply the annotation back from [here][kube-system-ns]

Perform the same process on the other two masters.

### Take stock of current running worker nodes

Create a `nodes` file listing all the current worker nodes:

```
kubectl get nodes | grep node | sed 's/ .*//' > nodes
```

### Create new worker instance groups

To ensure minimal application downtime, we're going to create new worker instance groups with the changes we applied to the live manifest above:

```
kops create instancegroup nodes-<kubernetes-version>-eu-west-2a
kops create instancegroup nodes-<kubernetes-version>-eu-west-2b
kops create instancegroup nodes-<kubernetes-version>-eu-west-2c
kops update cluster
kops update cluster --yes
```

> We use the kubernetes-version to identify the new node group.

New instances will be created, which you'll see with:

```
watch kubectl get nodes
```
  
### Cordon old workers

Create a script to cordon the old nodes, using the file we created earlier:

```
cat nodes | sed 's/^/kubectl cordon /' > cordon_nodes
```

Execute the new file:
  
```
bash cordon_nodes
```
  
### Scale the number of ingress controllers

To ensure ingress controllers are running on the new nodes run:

```
kubectl -n ingress-controllers edit deployment nginx-ingress-acme-controller
```

...and double the number of replicas.

### Drain the old worker nodes

Create a script to drain the old nodes, using the file we created earlier:

```
cat nodes | sed 's/^/kubectl drain /' | sed 's/$/ --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data/' > drain_nodes
```

Execute the new file:
  
```
bash drain_nodes
```

Each node will drain all pods, moving them onto the new workers.

### Validate the cluster

Ensure all nodes have joined the cluster:

```
kops validate cluster
```

### Run the integration tests again

Run the [integration test pipeline] and wait for the tests to pass. This will ensure the live cluster is functioning as expected.

### Delete the old instance groups

When complete and all pods have migrated onto the new workers. Delete the old instance groups:
  
```
kops delete instancegroup nodes-<old-kubernetes-version>-eu-west-2a
kops delete instancegroup nodes-<old-kubernetes-version>-eu-west-2b
kops delete instancegroup nodes-<old-kubernetes-version>-eu-west-2c
kops update cluster
kops update cluster --yes
```

### Scale the ingress-controllers down

We can now scale the ingress-controllers back down.

```
kubectl -n ingress-controllers edit deployment nginx-ingress-acme-controller
```
  
...and reduce the number of replicas.
