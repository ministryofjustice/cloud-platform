# Add Concourse to a test cluster

## Pre-requisites

- A [test cluster][create-test-cluster]. For this guide, we'll assume it's called `david-test1`
- You must have [fly] installed

## Process

- Go to [`cloud-platform-infrastructure/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks` directory](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks)
and update `node_groups_count` and `node_size` as below to match the Manager cluster configuration, as this will support the cpu and memory demands of the concourse module.

```
  node_groups_count = {
    live    = "64"
    live-2  = "7"
    manager = "4"
    default = "3" > "4"
  }
  node_size = {
    live    = ["r6i.2xlarge", "r6i.xlarge", "r5.2xlarge"]
    live-2  = ["r6i.2xlarge", "r6i.xlarge", "r5.2xlarge"]
    manager = ["m6a.xlarge", "m6a.2xlarge", "m6i.xlarge"]
    default = ["m6a.large", "m6a.xlarge", "m6i.large"] > ["m6a.xlarge", "m6a.2xlarge", "m6i.xlarge"]
  }
```
- Apply the changes using below terraform workflow:

```
terraform init
terraform workspace select <WorkspaceName>
terraform plan -var "enable_oidc_associate=false"
terraform apply -var "enable_oidc_associate=false"
```

- Go to [`cloud-platform-infrastructure/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components` directory](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components).
 Amend the following file and remove the count line from the [concourse module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components/concourse.tf).
- Apply the terraform module to your test cluster

```
terraform init
terraform workspace select <WorkspaceName>
terraform plan
terraform apply -target=module.concourse
```
- Clone the Concourse [repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-concourse).

- Login to Concourse

For this step, you will need to authenticate to Concourse using your instance's local username and password. These are stored in the kubernete secret `concourse-web` in
the `concourse` namespace, and can be obtained using the `cloud-platform` cli tool:

```
cloud-platform decode-secret -n concourse -s concourse-web
```
Username and password are stored in the `local-users` key-value pair:

```
"local-users": "[local-username]:[local-password]"
```

- Once you have these values to hand, login to Concourse with `fly`

```
fly --target david-test1 login \
    --team-name main \
    --concourse-url https://concourse.apps.david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```
Follow the URL this command outputs, choose to login with Username/Password, and enter your local username credentials.

- Apply your pipeline

Please do not deploy the bootstrap pipeline in the [Concourse repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-concourse/tree/main/pipelines/manager/main) into your test cluster. It is
for production level deployment and may trigger false alarms to our Slack Channel.

To ensure an isolated testing environment, please create a new folder on your local machine and start with a simple pipeline. You may use [this link](https://concourse-ci.org/tutorial-hello-world.html) as reference
to deploy the first pipeline into your test cluster and not the one under `manager/main`.

```
fly --target david-test1 set-pipeline \
    --pipeline plan-pipeline \
    --config pipelines/david-test1/main/plan-environments.yaml
```

Repeat this command whenever you make changes to the pipeline's yaml file.

- Set up secrets

If your pipeline requires secrets, such as AWS credentials, you need to define those as kubernetes secrets in the `concourse-main` namespace (or `concourse-<team name>` if you're using a different concourse team, rather than `main`)
