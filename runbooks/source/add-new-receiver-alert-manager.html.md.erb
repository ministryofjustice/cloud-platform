# Add a new Alertmanager receiver and a slack webhook

When Development Teams require to send custom alarms to their own channels, the Alertmanager receiver has to be added to the alertmanager.

## Pre-requisites

You must have the below details from the development team.

* namespace name
* team name
* application name
* slack channel
* severity level (warning/information)
* kubernetes secret which has the slack webhook url

## Creating a new receiver set

1. Fill in the template with the details provided from development team and add the array to [`terraform.tfvars`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/core/components/terraform.tfvars) file.
The `terraform.tfvars` file is encrypted so you have to `git-crypt unlock` to view the contents of the file.
Check [git-crypt documentation in user guide](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/git-crypt-setup.html#git-crypt) for more information on how to setup git-crypt.

    ```
    {
        severity = "<unique name based on team info provided ">
        webhook  = " webhook url>"
        channel  = "<slack channel>"
    }

    ```

2. Create a PR and merge the changes to master

3. Apply the terraform code changes to the live

Once the changes are applied, provide the `severity` to the development team requested. Development teams have to use the value as severity label when creating all custom application alerts.

An example receiver set and a prometheus rule will look as below

```
{
    severity = "cp-team"
    webhook  = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/HGJKHJKSH/DFJKHKIUO/DJFHKDUJFKSUHUGIDHKUDGD"
    channel  = "#cloud-platform-alerts"
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-custom-rules-my-application
spec:
  groups:
  - name: node.rules
    rules:
    - alert: Quota-Exceeded
      expr: 100 * kube_resourcequota{job="kube-state-metrics",type="used",namespace="monitoring"} / ignoring(instance, job, type) (kube_resourcequota{job="kube-state-metrics",type="hard"} > 0) > 90
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: cp-team
      annotations:
        message: Namespace {{ $labels.namespace }} is using {{ printf "%0.0f" $value}}% of its {{ $labels.resource }} quota.
        runbook_url: https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin/tree/master/runbook.md###alert-name-kubequotaexceeded
```

## Information Alerts

AlertManager receivers for slack integration are configured for 2 types of alerts.

1. to send a warning upon an alert rule condition is met and a recovery message once the condition is reversed
2. to send an information type alert for monitoring non-problem/non-failure events and no recovery message - e.g for rule condition to positively know something happened (like a database refresh, or app deployment etc) which is not a type of problem/failure.

All alerts are routed using the severity label set from the prometheus rule. If the severity label matches the keyword `info-`<severity>, then it is routed to information type receivers.
Hence, to receive information alert, prepend `info-` when setting the `severity` label of the prometheus rule.

An example receiver set and a prometheus rule will look as below

```
{
    severity = "cp-team"
    webhook  = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/HGJKHJKSH/DFJKHKIUO/DJFHKDUJFKSUHUGIDHKUDGD"
    channel  = "#cloud-platform-alerts"
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-custom-rules-my-application
spec:
  groups:
  - name: application-rules
    rules:
    - alert: Job completed
      expr: |-
        rate(kube_job_status_succeeded{job="kube-state-metrics",namespace="monitoring"}[5m]) > 0
      for: 30s
      labels:
        severity: info-cp-team # Should include `info-` before the severity mentioned in the receiver set above
        status_icon: information # To have a "i" icon instead of default "?"
      annotations:
        message: Latest backup checker Job completed on Namespace {{ $labels.namespace }}
```
