# Export data from Elasticsearch into a CSV file

This runbook aims to guide you through exporting data from Elasticsearch into a CSV file. 

The CSV Export feature in Kibana is a proprietary feature of Elasticsearch that requires X-Pack to be configured and installed in our Elasticsearch cluster which is not provided and supported in the Elasticsearch that is offered by AWS.

##  Workaround 

The workaround, is using [es2csv](https://github.com/gboddin/es2csv), which is a third party tool that saves the search result to a CSV file. Please refer this [blog page](https://www.skedler.com/blog/the-best-tools-for-exporting-elasticsearch-data-to-csv/) for more information.

Cloud-platform-live Elasticsearch endpoint (https://search-cloud-platform-live-dibidbfud3uww3lpxnhj2jdws4.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com) is accessible within the cluster.

### Install es2csv

kubectl exec in to any of the fluentd pod in logging namespace and install es2csv

  ```
  kubectl -n logging exec -ti fluentd-es-xxxxx -- /bin/bash
  ```

You also need Python 2.7.x and pip

  ```bash
  apt update
  apt install python-pip
  pip install es2csv
  ```

You can view the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/gboddin/es2csv#installation)

### Usage

```
es2csv -q 'kubernetes.namespace_name:starter-pack' -u https://<ES_endpoint>:443   -i logstash-* -f kubernetes_cluster -o kibanatest.csv --verify-certs

	Here, the parameters are :
		-q Query
		-u URL
		-i Indices
		-f Fields to be preserved
		-o Output file name
```

For more usage examples please refer [this](https://github.com/taraslayshchuk/es2csv/blob/master/docs/EXAMPLES.rst)

Note: Once the export is completed, delete the fluentd pod you installed es2csv
