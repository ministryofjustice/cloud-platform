# Grafana Dashboards

## Kubernetes Number of Pods per Node  

This [dashboard](https://grafana.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/d/anzGBBJHiz/kubernetes-number-of-pods-per-node?orgId=1) was created to show the current number of pods per node in the cluster. 


### Dashboard Layout 

Each box on the dashboard has the name of the node and the number of pods on the node  - This number includes pods with a statuses such as "DeadlineExceeded" and completed".

The exception is the `Max Pods per Node` box. This is a constant number set on creation for the maximum allowed pods per node. 

The current architecture does not allow instance group id to be viewed on the dashboard: 

We currently have 5 instance groups:

* Masters (one per each of the 3 availability zones in the London region)
* Nodes
* 2xlarge Nodes

As the dashboard is set in descending order, the last two boxes are normally from the 2xlarge Nodes group (2 instances), the next 3 boxes are normally the masters, and the rest are from the Nodes group.

You can run the following command to confirm this and get more information about a node:

```
kubectl describe node <node_name>
```
