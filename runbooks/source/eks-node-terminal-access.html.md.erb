## Overview

AWS System Session Manager is used to configure and manage a terminal access to EKS worker nodes.

All EKS clusters are created with needed permissions for
AWS System Session Manager to start sessions to the worker nodes.

On the AWS Console, **Services -> AWS System Manager -> Quick Setup for Host Management** is configured to detect the `live` EKS cluster worker nodes(default & monitoring)
by tag `Cluster` with value `live`.

## Pre-requisites

- AWS Console access
- Session Manager plugin (if using AWS Cli). To install Session Manager plugin on macOS,

    ```
    brew install --cask session-manager-plugin
    ```

## Steps to get terminal access via Console

- Get the Instance Name of the node you want to login using kubectl

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

- Login to AWS Console, **Services -> EC2** and search by giving the `Instance Name`
- Select the instance and then click **Connect**
- Select the **Connection method -> Session Manager**

## Steps to get terminal access via AWS cli

- Get the **Instance ID** of the node you want to login using kubectl

    ```
    # To get the list of nodes and their names
    kubectl get nodes

    # To get the node ID of the node for given node name
    kubectl describe node <node name you want to shell into> | grep 'ProviderID' | awk -F '/' '{print $NF}'`

    ```

- Start the session with cli command

    ```
    aws ssm start-session --target <Instance ID>
    ```

## Access via SSH /SCP

It can be more convenient to access the nodes using the standard ssh client, esp when copying files.

To set up, add the following in `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host i-*
  User ssm-user
  ProxyCommand bash -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
```

Connect and append your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` key to the `/home/ssm-user/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the node.

Now you can `ssh i-0abcdef` or `scp 1-0abcdef:file`
