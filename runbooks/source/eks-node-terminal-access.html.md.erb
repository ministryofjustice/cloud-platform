## Overview

AWS System Session Manager is used to configure and manage a terminal access to EKS worker nodes. 

All EKS clusters are created with needed permissions for
AWS System Session Manager to start sessions to the worker nodes.

On the AWS Console, **Services -> AWS System Manager -> Quick Setup for Host Management** is configured to detect the `live` EKS cluster worker nodes(default & monitoring) 
by tag `Cluster` with value `live`. 

## Pre-requisites

- AWS Console access 
- Session Manager plugin (if using AWS Cli). To install Session Manager plugin on macOS, 

    ```
    brew install --cask session-manager-plugin
    ```

## Steps to get terminal access via Console

- Get the Instance Name of the node you want to login using kubectl

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

- Login to AWS Console, **Services -> EC2** and search by giving the `Instance Name`
- Select the instance and then click **Connect**
- Select the **Connection method -> Session Manager**

## Steps to get terminal access via AWS cli

- Get the **Instance ID** of the node you want to login using kubectl

    ```
    # To get the list of nodes and their names
    kubectl get nodes 

    # To get the node ID of the node for given node name
    kubectl describe node <node name you want to shell into> | grep 'ProviderID' | awk -F '/' '{print $NF}'` 
  
    ```

- Start the session with cli command

    ```
    aws ssm start-session --target <Instance ID>
    ```
