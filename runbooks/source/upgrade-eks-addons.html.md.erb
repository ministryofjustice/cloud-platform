# Upgrade EKS addons

We have 3 addons managed through cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons [module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons).

Before every EKS major versions, check and upgrade if the addons versions don't match the EKS major version the cluster is currently on.

After every EKS major versions, check  and upgrade if the addons don't match the EKS major version the cluster you just upgraded to.

The following addons are managed through cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons module.

[managing-kube-proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-kube-proxy.html)

[managing-coredns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-coredns.html)

[managing-vpc-cni](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-vpc-cni.html)

## Preparing for upgrade

Check the changelog for each of the addons and determine if there are any breaking changes.

Create a thread in #cloud-platform notifying the team that upgrades are starting and the pipelines will be paused.

## Starting the upgrade

1. Bump the version number in cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons
2. Commit changes on a new branch and create a pull request
3. Request review from someone on the team
4. Merge pull request and create a new release through the Github UI
5. Bump the version number of the cloud-platform-terraform-eks-add-ons in cloud-platform-infrastructure
6. Commit changes on a new branch and create a pull request
7. Request review form someone on the team
8. Check the terraform plan in concourse and pause the following pipelines:
  * bootstrap
  * infrastructure-live
  * infrastructure-manager
  * infrastructure-live-2
9. Create an output of the configuration of a pod before the upgrade. `kubectl -n kube-system get pod $addon -oyaml` there is also a helper [script](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/scripts/addons-upgrade.bash).
10. Merge the pull request
11. Unpause an infrastructure pipeline and wait for it to complete
12. While running:
  * Keep an eye on pods recycling `watch -n 1 "kubectl -n kube-system get pods"`
  * Keep an eye on events `watch -n 1 "kubectl -n kube-system get events"`
13. Run the reporting pipeline on the infrastructure environment
14. If everythin is green repeat steps 11-14 on each environment.

## Finish the upgrade

Finish up communications and close the thread.
