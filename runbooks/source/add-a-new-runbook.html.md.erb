* `cd runbooks`
* Run `make preview` to start a development webserver to view your changes
* Add your runbook as a new file in the [source] directory

```

- The `weight` value controls ordering in the table of contents
- Use `position * 100` to leave enough room for new runbooks to be inserted without reordering
- Do not put leading zeroes on the `weight` value, they won't work

- Your content **must** start with a markdown heading one line, e.g.

```
# Add a new runbook
```

You can also use this to use the title as the heading

```
# <%%= current_page.data.title %>
```

#### 6. Push your feature branch and raise a PR
#### 7. Merge your PR and delete your feature branch

A GitHub action will compile and deploy a new version of the runbooks guide, with your changes.
