# Add a new runbook

To add a new runbook, you will create a file in the `runbooks/source` directory of the [cloud-platform] repository.

#### 1. `git pull` to get the latest changes
#### 2. Create a feature branch for your new runbook
#### 3. `cd runbooks`
#### 4. Run `make server` to start a development webserver to view your changes
#### 5. Add your runbook as a new file in the [source] directory

* Your filename must match `*.html.md.erb`
* Your file must have a header section like this

```

- The `weight` value controls ordering in the table of contents
- Use `position * 100` to leave enough room for new runbooks to be inserted without reordering
- Do not put leading zeroes on the `weight` value, they won't work

- Your content **must** start with a markdown heading one line, e.g.

```
# Add a new runbook
```

You can also use this to use the title as the heading

```
# <%= current_page.data.title %>
```

#### 6. Push your feature branch and raise a PR
#### 7. Merge your PR and delete your feature branch

CircleCI will compile and deploy a new version of the runbooks guide, with your changes.
