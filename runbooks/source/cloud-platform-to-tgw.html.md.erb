# Adding a route to connect to a TGW

This document is a description of the current Cloud Platform & TGW setup. 
It also explain how to modify the relevant route table

*The scope of this guide is limited on purpose, it only covers the Cloud Platform responsibilities.
The techops/cloud-ops team is able to share the Transit Gateways with other AWS accounts.*

## Quick introduction

AWS Transit Gateways allows VPCs, from different accounts or regions, to be connected securely.
Transit Gateways have their own route-table. 
Transit Gateways (TGW) also support connecting to VPNs, AWS Direct Connect and other Transit Gateway

An important limitation: a TGW can only work with VPCs in the same region it is in. However, TGW from different regions can be peered.

The MoJ current Transit Gateway infrastructure is managed here : [github repository]

## Transit Gateway

The Cloud Platform VPC is attached to the eu-west-2 TGW located in the `moj-transit-gateway` account.
However, the attachment alone doesn't allow traffic to flow: A new route need to be added to VPC's route-table for each target VPC.

Example: The Analytical Platform(AP) wants to access the Cloud Platform (CP) VPC. 
 - Both are attached the the TGW 
 - The CP route-table should contain a route with the CP VPC's CIDR block as a destination, but with the TGW ID as a target.
 - The same needs to be done on the AP VPC, to route back to CP.

## Making the change

Everything is managed in the github repository, in the route.tf file of the [cloud-platform folder]
Only an admin of the cloud-platform (`moj-cp`) is able to run that code. 

Here is the snippet to add to the route.tf :
```
resource "aws_route" "my-new-route" {
        count = length(local.route_tables)
        route_table_id            = local.route_tables[count.index]
        destination_cidr_block    = "100.X.X.X/22"
        transit_gateway_id        = "my-eu-west-2-TGW"
}
```

The TGW gateway ID can be found in the Readme of the repo. 

Note: Something similar need to be done on the 'other side', terraform or not.
