# AWS Compromised Credentials

This article was created to minimise our window of exposure.

## Steps for a leaked credentials

1) Login into our AWS Management Console

2) Go to **Services -> IAM** and search for the user with the leaked credentials (**TIP** You can search either by *Access Keys* or by *Username*). In case you prefer using the CLI:

```
aws iam list-users --output json --query 'Users[?contains(UserName, `testAlejandro`)  == `true`]'
```

3) Within the User, click on "Delete user" button (top right corner). If you prefer to use the CLI, you'll have to delete dependencies (Access Keys, Groups, etc), an example can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/kgmoore431/886aa60cd7fdc9a43bc5c05f9e956adf).

4) If the service team is known, we should notify them via their slack channel (and @ the specific user). If the service team isn't known, messages should be sent privately on Slack.

## Getting new credentials

Most of the users and keys are created through terraform, the process to recreate them are [here](rotate-user-aws-credentials.html#4-let-terraform-create-a-new-key)

## Audit the compromised credentials

Check CloudTrail for any activity of the credentials after it got exposed. This can be done by logging into AWS Management Console
Go to Services -> CloudTrail -> Event history and filter by `AWS access key`.
