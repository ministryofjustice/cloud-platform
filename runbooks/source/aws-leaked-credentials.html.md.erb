# AWS Compromised Credentials 

This article is the immediate response, it was created to minimise our window of exposure

## Steps for a leaked credentials

1) Login into our AWS Management Console

2) Go to **Services -> IAM** and search for the user with credentials leaked (**TIP** You can search either by *Access Keys* or by *Username*). In case you prefer using the CLI: 

```
aws iam list-users --output json --query 'Users[?contains(UserName, `testAlejandro`)  == `true`]'
```

3) Within the User, click in "Delete user" button (top right corner). If you prefer to use the CLI you'll have to delete dependencies (Access Keys, Groups, etc), an example can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/kgmoore431/886aa60cd7fdc9a43bc5c05f9e956adf).

4) If the service team is known we should notify them via their slack channel (and @ the specific user). If the service team isn't known message should be sent privately on Slack.

## Getting new credentials

Most of the users and keys are created through terraform, the process to recreate them are [here](rotate-user-aws-credentials.html#4-let-terraform-create-a-new-key)
