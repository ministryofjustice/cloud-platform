When you see a `PrometheusOperatorReconcile` alert in the `#lower-priority-alarms` channel, it means that the Prometheus Operator is unable to reconcile the state of the Prometheus resources in the cluster.
This means some of the prometheus rules or alerts are having issues and has not applied fine.

## Troubleshooting

Check the logs of the Prometheus Operator pod to see if there are any errors:

```bash
kubectl logs -n monitoring prometheus-operator-kube-p-operator-<pod-id> -f
```

If you see any error like below:

```
level=info ts=2024-02-23T10:31:29.0543824Z caller=rules.go:345
component=prometheusoperator msg="Invalid rule" err="group
\"XXX-elasticache\", rule 1, \"elasticache-enginecpu-utilisation\":
annotation \"message\": template: __alert_elasticache-enginecpu-utilisation:1:
undefined variable \"$clusterId\""
```

This could stops Prometheus from sending out alerts to certain channels and stops changes/new ones being created. You may also see an alert
[PrometheusErrorSendingAlertsToSomeAlertmanagers](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C8QR5FQRX/p1718608823815629) if that was the case.

You will need to fix the erroring PrometheusRule.

If the rule is not configured in [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) repository,
find the namespace that rule is applied and get the team slack-channel or the last person who made a change and inform them to fix the rule.
