# Upgrade cluster components

Cluster components are application layer components that are installed in a cluster such as prometheus, external-dns, opa, certmanager etc.

Components are configured as terraform modules and are called from [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo] with a release tag.

## Planning

When you start working on upgrading any cloud-platform-components ticket:

- Check which chart versions are available to upgrade to
- Check whether the component is upgradeable to that chart version from the current one (some major versions cannot be skipped)
- Check the release notes of the component for any breaking changes
- Check and add notes from the upgrading process mentioned in the original github repository related the component (if any)
- Check and add notes of every CHANGELOG.md of the component between the current chart version installed in your cluster to the chart version you want to upgrade to
- Review the CHANGELOG notes with another member of the team (check for breaking changes, deprecations, change to values file and suggested plan for upgrading the production clusters `live-1`, `eks-manager` and `live`)

## Testing the upgrade in a test cluster

It is important to test the upgrade of the component in both kops and EKS cluster.

- Your GPG key must be added to the [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo] so that you are able to run `git-crypt unlock`

- You have the [AWS CLI] profile `moj-cp` with suitable credentials

- You have [docker] installed

### Setup environment

Setup the environment variables listed in [example.env.create-cluster] in the [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo].

### Run a shell in the tools image

The cloud platform [tools image] has all the software required to update a cluster.

From a local copy of the [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo],  run the following command:

```bash
make tools-shell
```

### Authenticate to the test cluster

Create the file `~/.kube/config` in your tools-image container by running:

```bash
aws eks --region eu-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>
```

### Run the integration tests

This will ensure the test cluster does not have any existing issues and is ready to use.

 To run Go tests:

```bash
make run-tests
```

### Testing the upgrade

  1. Make the changes required to the module. For example, for upgrading the cert-manager, change the [cert-manager terraform module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-certmanager). This might include
      - The helm chart version
      - changes to the values file (in needed)

  2. Push changes to a branch(upgrade) of the module

  3. Update the local copy of the [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo] with the branch reference.
     For cert-manager module, the code would change to

    ```hcl
    source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-certmanager?ref=upgrade"
    ```

  4. Do a `terraform plan` for the changes, verify whether the changes are correct and do `terraform apply` to apply the changes

  5. Check the [things to observe] section for specific components

  6. Run the integration tests again

  4. Once the testing is complete and integration tests are passed, create a PR to be reviewed by the team and have the module unit tests passed.
     After the PR is approved, merge the changes to the main branch of the module and make a release.

  5. Change the module release tag in the kops/components and eks/components folder of [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo] and raise a PR.
     Verify the terraform plan from the [cloud-platform-infrastructure plan pipeline] and get it reviewed by the team.

  6. Once approved, merge the PR and monitor the [cloud-platform-infrastructure apply pipeline] when applying the changes.

### Things to observe when testing the upgrade

  The below are some of the general things to check when during the upgrade and not a complete list.


### Performing the upgrade

There is a cli command to perform the upgrade. First navigate to the [cloud-platform-infrastructure repo] and run the following command:

```bash
cloud-platform environments bump-module --module <module-name> --module-version <version>
```
The `module-name` flag must contain a word in the module source. For example, if you were to upgrade the cert-manager module to 0.5.0, you would run the following command:

```bash
cloud-platform environment bump-module --module certmanager --module-version 0.5.0
```

#### Cert manager

  - The CRDs for cert-manager doesnot get deleted
  - The existing certificates doesnot change in any way. This can be done by checking the timestamps of certificate creation
  - Able to create and validate new certificates


#### Prometheus

  - Ensure correct CRDs versions of prometheus-operator are updated before upgrading prometheus-operator
  - The existing PrometheusRules and ServiceMonitors doesnot change in any way. This can be done by checking the timestamps of those resourse creation
  - Able to query prometheus for metrics
