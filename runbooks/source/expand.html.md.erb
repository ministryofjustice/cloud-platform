# Expanding Persistent Volumes created using StatefulSets
It is currently not possible to expand PVs created using a StatefulSet directly from the StatefulSet template.

This is the current work around -

Edit the 'storage' value under spec:resources for PVC required to be expanded:

```yaml
kubectl edit pvc www-web-0
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi # edit with new value
  storageClassName: gp2
  volumeName: pvc-489b1857-91dd-11e9-b4c5-0a5b8815a91e
```

Once the edit has been applied, you should see `type: Resizing` under status:conditions:

```yaml
kubectl get pvc www-web-0 -o yaml
status:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 4Gi
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: null
    lastTransitionTime: 2019-06-18T15:29:45Z
    status: "True"
    type: Resizing # You should see value
  phase: Bound
```

Delete the corresponding pod associated to the pv:

```bash
kubectl delete pod web-0
pod "web-0" deleted
```

Once pod is recreated, you should see the new pv disc size in the pvc

```yaml
kubectl get pvc www-web-0 -o yaml
status:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  phase: Bound
```

The following command will delete the StatefulSet without deleting the associated pods

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset --cascade=false web # `web` is the name of the StatefulSet
```

Apply the StatefulSet template with new pvc size (with everything else exactly the same) to your namespace.

There is an [open issue] for expanding PVs using StatefulSet templates in github. Once this is implemented, the above workaround will no longer be required.
