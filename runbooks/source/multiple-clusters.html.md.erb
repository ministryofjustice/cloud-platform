## Overview

Currently all information related to handling multiple clusters in terms of requirements and possible solutions, can be found in this ticket:

[Multi-cluster Stage 1 - Make test cluster more realistic](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/2388)

[Explore how to manage terraform state on a multi-cluster platform](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cloud-platform-team-5ccb0b8a81f66118c983c189/issues/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/1817) 

## Components installed only in live-1 cluster

Below is the list of components and how to enable them in test clusters for testing if required

- Ingress Controllers

  For `live-1` External DNS annotation include domains from `var.live_domain` with default value `*.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`
  Variable to enable: `is_live_cluster` to `true`.
     
- Kuberos

    Provision the aws-redirect ingress. Required only once and hence applied in live-1
    Variable to enable: `create_aws_redirect` to `true`

- Logging

  Fluent-bit connects to the `cloud-platform-live` and `cloud-platform-audit` elasticsearch cluster to send output logs.
  For test cluster, there is a placeholder instead.
  
  There is also a curator cron job which runs every hour to delete incices older than 30 days 
  of `cloud-platform-live` elasticsearch cluster

  To link a test elasticsearch cluster to the fluent-bit, set the test elasticsearch cluster endpoints to variables below.
  - for container logs `elasticsearch_host`
  - for audit logs `elasticsearch_audit_host`
  - To enable curator cron job - `enable_curator_cronjob`

- Prometheus

  Thanos sidecar components gets deployed with a prometheus instance only for `live-1` and `manager` cluster.
  Variable to enable: `enable_thanos_sidecar` to `true`
