## About this Repository
This is the MoJ Cloud Platform team's repository for public facing
documentation, feature work, enhancements, and issues. Waffle users can add issues
through GitHub Issues or directly on our [Waffle
board](https://waffle.io/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform).

It's best to search our board before adding new Issues in an effort to
reduce duplicates and encourage activity on existing conversations.

## Cloud platform repo list

We have a series of repositories for our work that we have listed below. We have adopted the naming convention of starting each repo with `cloud-platform-`. Where some repos have a similar purpose we try to name them similarly, (e.g. `cloud-platform-terraform-*` for terraform modules). We also try to [name things](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/standards/naming-things/#naming-things) so that users can infer a basic understanding of what a given thing does from its name.
