## Cloud platform repo list

We have a series of repositories for our work that we have listed below. We have adopted the naming convention of starting each repo with `cloud-platform-`. Where some repos have a similar purpose we try to name them similarly, (e.g. `cloud-platform-terraform-*` for terraform modules). We also try to [name things](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/naming-things.html#naming-things) so that users can infer a basic understanding of what a given thing does from its name.
